  <p>Rotates a 2D vector by an angle without changing its magnitude.

  By convention, the positive x-axis has an angle of 0. Angles increase in

  the clockwise direction.</p>

  <p>If the vector was created with

  <a href="#/p5/createVector">createVector()</a>, <code>rotate()</code> uses

  the units of the current <a href="#/p5/angleMode">angleMode()</a>.</p>

  <p>The static version of <code>rotate()</code>, as in
  <code>p5.Vector.rotate(v, PI)</code>,

  returns a new <a href="#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object and doesn't change

  the original.</p>
