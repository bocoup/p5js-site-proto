  <p>Executes the code within <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> one time. This

  function allows the program to update the display window only when necessary,

  for example when an event registered by <a
  href="#/p5/mousePressed">mousePressed()</a>

  or <a href="#/p5/keyPressed">keyPressed()</a> occurs.</p>

  <p>In structuring a program, it only makes sense to call <a
  href="#/p5/redraw">redraw()</a>

  within events such as <a href="#/p5/mousePressed">mousePressed()</a>. This

  is because <a href="#/p5/redraw">redraw()</a> does not run

  <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> immediately (it only sets a flag that indicates

  an update is needed).</p>

  <p>The <a href="#/p5/redraw">redraw()</a> function does not work properly when

  called inside <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>.To enable/disable animations,

  use <a href="#/p5/loop">loop()</a> and <a href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition you can set the number of redraws per method call. Just

  add an integer as single parameter for the number of redraws.</p>
