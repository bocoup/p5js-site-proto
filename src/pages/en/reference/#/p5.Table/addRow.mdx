  <p>Use <a href="#/p5/addRow">addRow()</a> to add a new row of data to a <a
  href="#/p5.Table">p5.Table</a> object. By default,

  an empty row is created. Typically, you would store a reference to

  the new row in a TableRow object (see newRow in the example above),

  and then set individual values using <a href="#/p5/set">set()</a>.</p>

  <p>If a <a href="#/p5.TableRow">p5.TableRow</a> object is included as a
  parameter, then that row is

  duplicated and added to the table.</p>
