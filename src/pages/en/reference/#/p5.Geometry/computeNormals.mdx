description: >
  <p>This function calculates normals for each face, where each vertex's normal
  is the average of the normals of all faces it's connected to.

  i.e computes smooth normals per vertex as an average of each face.</p>

  <p>When using <code>FLAT</code> shading, vertices are disconnected/duplicated
  i.e each face has its own copy of vertices.

  When using <code>SMOOTH</code> shading, vertices are connected/deduplicated
  i.e each face has its vertices shared with other faces.</p>

  <p>Options can include:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><code>roundToPrecision</code>: Precision value for rounding computations.
  Defaults to 3.</li>

  </ul>

  A star-like geometry, here the computeNormals(SMOOTH) is applied for a smooth
  shading effect.

  This helps to avoid the faceted appearance that can occur with flat shading.
