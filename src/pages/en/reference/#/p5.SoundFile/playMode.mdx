  <p>p5.SoundFile has two play modes: <code>restart</code> and
  <code>sustain</code>. Play Mode determines what happens to a
  p5.SoundFile if it is triggered while in the middle of playback.
  In sustain mode, playback will continue simultaneous to the
  new playback. In restart mode, play() will stop playback
  and start over. With untilDone, a sound will play only if it's
  not already playing. Sustain is the default mode.</p>
