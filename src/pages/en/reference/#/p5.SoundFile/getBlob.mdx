  <p>This method is useful for sending a SoundFile to a server. It returns the
  .wav-encoded audio data as a "<a target="_blank" title="Blob reference at
  MDN" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob">Blob</a>".
  A Blob is a file-like data object that can be uploaded to a server
  with an <a href="/reference/#/p5/httpDo">http</a> request. We'll
  use the <code>httpDo</code> options object to send a POST request with some
  specific options: we encode the request as <code>multipart/form-data</code>,
  and attach the blob as one of the form values using <code>FormData</code>.</p>
