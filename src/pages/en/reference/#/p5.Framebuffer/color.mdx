description: |
  <p>A texture with the color information of the framebuffer. Pass this (or the
  framebuffer itself) to <a href="#/p5/texture">texture()</a> to draw it to
  the canvas, or pass it to a shader with
  <a href="#/p5.Shader/setUniform">setUniform()</a> to read its data.</p>
  <p>Since Framebuffers are controlled by WebGL, their y coordinates are stored
  flipped compared to images and videos. When texturing with a framebuffer
  texture, you may want to flip vertically, e.g. with
  <code>plane(framebuffer.width, -framebuffer.height)</code>.</p>
