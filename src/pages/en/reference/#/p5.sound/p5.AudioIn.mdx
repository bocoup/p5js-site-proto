description: >-
  <p>Get audio from an input, i.e. your computer's microphone.</p>


  <p>Turn the mic on/off with the start() and stop() methods. When the mic

  is on, its volume can be measured with getLevel or by connecting an

  FFT object.</p>


  <p>If you want to hear the AudioIn, use the .connect() method.

  AudioIn does not connect to p5.sound output by default to prevent

  feedback.</p>


  <p><em>Note: This uses the <a href="http://caniuse.com/stream">getUserMedia/

  Stream</a> API, which is not supported by certain browsers. Access in Chrome
  browser

  is limited to localhost and https, but access over http may be
  limited.</em></p>

  - name: errorCallback
    description: |
      <p>A function to call if there is an error
                                        accessing the AudioIn. For example,
                                        Safari and iOS devices do not
                                        currently allow microphone access.</p>
    type: Function
    optional: true
enabled:
  description: |
    <p>Client must allow browser to access their microphone / audioin source.
    Default: false. Will become true when the client enables access.</p>

amplitude:
  description: |
    <p>Input amplitude, connect to it by default but not to master out</p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.AudioIn/
start:
  description: |
    <p>Start processing audio input. This enables the use of other
    AudioIn methods like getLevel(). Note that by default, AudioIn
    is not connected to p5.sound's output. So you won't hear
    anything unless you use the connect() method.<br/></p>
    <p>Certain browsers limit access to the user's microphone. For example,
    Chrome only allows access from localhost and over https. For this reason,
    you may want to include an errorCallbackâ€”a function that is called in case
    the browser won't provide mic access.</p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.AudioIn/
stop:
  description: |
    <p>Turn the AudioIn off. If the AudioIn is stopped, it cannot getLevel().
    If re-starting, the user may be prompted for permission access.</p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.AudioIn/
connect:
  description: |
    <p>Connect to an audio unit. If no parameter is provided, will
    connect to the main output (i.e. your speakers).<br/></p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.AudioIn/
disconnect:
  description: |
    <p>Disconnect the AudioIn from all audio units. For example, if
    connect() had been called, disconnect() will stop sending
    signal to your speakers.<br/></p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.AudioIn/
getLevel:
  description: |
    <p>Read the Amplitude (volume level) of an AudioIn. The AudioIn
    class contains its own instance of the Amplitude class to help
    make it easy to get a microphone's volume level. Accepts an
    optional smoothing value (0.0 < 1.0). <em>NOTE: AudioIn must
    .start() before using .getLevel().</em><br/></p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.AudioIn/

  description: |
    <p>Set amplitude (volume) of a mic input between 0 and 1.0. <br/></p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.AudioIn/
getSources:
  description: |
    <p>Returns a list of available input sources. This is a wrapper
    for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/
    en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/enumerateDevices" target="_blank">
    MediaDevices.enumerateDevices() - Web APIs | MDN</a>
    and it returns a Promise.</p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.AudioIn/
setSource:
  description: |
    <p>Set the input source. Accepts a number representing a
    position in the array returned by getSources().
    This is only available in browsers that support
     <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/
     en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/enumerateDevices" target="_blank">
     navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()</a></p>
