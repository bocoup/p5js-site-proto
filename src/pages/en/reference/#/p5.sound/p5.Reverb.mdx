description: >
  <p>Reverb adds depth to a sound through a large number of decaying

  echoes. It creates the perception that sound is occurring in a

  physical space. The p5.Reverb has paramters for Time (how long does the

  reverb last) and decayRate (how much the sound decays with each echo)

  that can be set with the .set() or .process() methods. The p5.Convolver

  extends p5.Reverb allowing you to recreate the sound of actual physical

  spaces through convolution.</p>
