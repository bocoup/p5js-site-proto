  <p>Delay is an echo effect. It processes an existing sound source,

  and outputs a delayed version of that sound. The p5.Delay can

  produce different effects depending on the delayTime, feedback,

  filter, and type. In the example below, a feedback of 0.5 (the

  default value) will produce a looping delay that decreases in

  volume by 50% each repeat. A filter will cut out the high

  frequencies so that the delay does not sound as piercing as the

  original source.</p>

delayTime:
  description: |
    <p>Set the delay (echo) time, in seconds. Usually this value will be
    a floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.Delay/
feedback:
  description: |
    <p>Feedback occurs when Delay sends its signal back through its input
    in a loop. The feedback amount determines how much signal to send each
    time through the loop. A feedback greater than 1.0 is not desirable because
    it will increase the overall output each time through the loop,
    creating an infinite feedback loop. The default value is 0.5</p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.Delay/
filter:
  description: |
    <p>Set a lowpass filter frequency for the delay. A lowpass filter
    will cut off any frequencies higher than the filter frequency.</p>
  path: ./src/pages/en/reference/#/p5.Delay/
setType:
  description: |
    <p>Choose a preset type of delay. 'pingPong' bounces the signal
    from the left to the right channel to produce a stereo effect.
    Any other parameter will revert to the default delay setting.</p>
