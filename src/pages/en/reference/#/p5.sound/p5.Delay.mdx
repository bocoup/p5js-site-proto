description: >
  <p>Delay is an echo effect. It processes an existing sound source,

  and outputs a delayed version of that sound. The p5.Delay can

  produce different effects depending on the delayTime, feedback,

  filter, and type. In the example below, a feedback of 0.5 (the

  default value) will produce a looping delay that decreases in

  volume by 50% each repeat. A filter will cut out the high

  frequencies so that the delay does not sound as piercing as the

  original source.</p>
