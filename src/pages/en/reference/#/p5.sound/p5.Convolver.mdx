  <p>p5.Convolver extends p5.Reverb. It can emulate the sound of real
  physical spaces through a process called <a href="
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_reverb#Real_space_simulation">
  convolution</a>.</p>

  <p>Convolution multiplies any audio input by an "impulse response"
  to simulate the dispersion of sound over time. The impulse response is
  generated from an audio file that you provide. One way to
  generate an impulse response is to pop a balloon in a reverberant space
  and record the echo. Convolution can also be used to experiment with
  sound.</p>

  <p>Use the method <code>createConvolution(path)</code> to instantiate a
  p5.Convolver with a path to your impulse response audio file.</p>
