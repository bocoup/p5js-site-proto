  <p>p5.EQ is an audio effect that performs the function of a multiband

  audio equalizer. Equalization is used to adjust the balance of

  frequency compoenents of an audio signal. This process is commonly used

  in sound production and recording to change the waveform before it reaches

  a sound output device. EQ can also be used as an audio effect to create

  interesting distortions by filtering out parts of the spectrum. p5.EQ is

  built using a chain of Web Audio Biquad Filter Nodes and can be

  instantiated with 3 or 8 bands. Bands can be added or removed from

  the EQ by directly modifying p5.EQ.bands (the array that stores filters).</p>
