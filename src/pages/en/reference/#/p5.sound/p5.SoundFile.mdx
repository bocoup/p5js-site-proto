  <p>SoundFile object with a path to a file.</p>

  <p>The p5.SoundFile may not be available immediately because
  it loads the file information asynchronously.</p>

  <p>To do something with the sound as soon as it loads
  pass the name of a function as the second parameter.</p>

  <p>Only one file path is required. However, audio file formats
  (i.e. mp3, ogg, wav and m4a/aac) are not supported by all
  web browsers. If you want to ensure compatability, instead of a single
  file path, you may include an Array of filepaths, and the browser will
  choose a format that works.</p>

      <p>path to a sound file (String). Optionally,
                                   you may include multiple file formats in
                                   an array. Alternately, accepts an object
                                   from the HTML5 File API, or a p5.File.</p>

      <p>Name of a function to call if file fails to
                                          load. This function will receive an error or

                                         about what went wrong.</p>

                                                 is loading. That function will
                                                 receive progress of the request to
                                                 load the sound file
                                                 (between 0 and 1) as its first
                                                 parameter. This progress
                                                 does not account for the additional
                                                 time needed to decode the audio data.</p>
