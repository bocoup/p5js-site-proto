  <p>Record sounds for playback and/or to save as a .wav file.
  The p5.SoundRecorder records all sound output from your sketch,
  or can be assigned a specific source with setInput().</p>
  <p>The record() method accepts a p5.SoundFile as a parameter.
  When playback is stopped (either after the given amount of time,
  or with the stop() method), the p5.SoundRecorder will send its
  recording to that p5.SoundFile for playback.</p>

    <p>Start recording. To access the recording, provide
    a p5.SoundFile as the first parameter. The p5.SoundRecorder
    will send its recording to that p5.SoundFile for playback once
    recording is complete. Optional parameters include duration
    (in seconds) of the recording, and a callback function that
    will be called once the complete recording has been
    transfered to the p5.SoundFile.</p>

    <p>Stop the recording. Once the recording is stopped,
    the results will be sent to the p5.SoundFile that
    was given on .record(), and if a callback function
    was provided on record, that function will be called.</p>
