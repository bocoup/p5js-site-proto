  <p>FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is an analysis algorithm that
  isolates individual
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency">
  audio frequencies</a> within a waveform.</p>

  <p>Once instantiated, a p5.FFT object can return an array based on
  two types of analyses: <br> • <code>FFT.waveform()</code> computes
  amplitude values along the time domain. The array indices correspond
  to samples across a brief moment in time. Each value represents
  amplitude of the waveform at that sample of time.<br>
  • <code>FFT.analyze() </code> computes amplitude values along the
  frequency domain. The array indices correspond to frequencies (i.e.
  pitches), from the lowest to the highest that humans can hear. Each
  value represents amplitude at that slice of the frequency spectrum.
  Use with <code>getEnergy()</code> to measure amplitude at specific
  frequencies, or within a range of frequencies. </p>

  <p>FFT analyzes a very short snapshot of sound called a sample
  buffer. It returns an array of amplitude measurements, referred
  to as <code>bins</code>. The array is 1024 bins long by default.
  You can change the bin array length, but it must be a power of 2
  between 16 and 1024 in order for the FFT algorithm to function
  correctly. The actual size of the FFT buffer is twice the
  number of bins, so given a standard sample rate, the buffer is
  2048/44100 seconds long.</p>
