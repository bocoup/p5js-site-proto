  <p>debugMode() helps visualize 3D space by adding a grid to indicate where the

  ‘ground’ is in a sketch and an axes icon which indicates the +X, +Y, and +Z

  directions. This function can be called without parameters to create a

  default grid and axes icon, or it can be called according to the examples

  above to customize the size and position of the grid and/or axes icon.  The

  grid is drawn using the most recently set stroke color and weight.  To

  specify these parameters, add a call to stroke() and strokeWeight()

  just before the end of the draw() loop.</p>

  <p>By default, the grid will run through the origin (0,0,0) of the sketch

  along the XZ plane

  and the axes icon will be offset from the origin.  Both the grid and axes

  icon will be sized according to the current canvas size.  Note that because
  the

  grid runs parallel to the default camera view, it is often helpful to use

  debugMode along with orbitControl to allow full view of the grid.</p>
