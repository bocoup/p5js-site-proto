  <p>The p5.js API provides a lot of functionality for creating graphics, but
  there is

  some native HTML5 Canvas functionality that is not exposed by p5. You can
  still call

  it directly using the variable <code>drawingContext</code>, as in the example
  shown. This is

  the equivalent of calling <code>canvas.getContext('2d');</code> or
  <code>canvas.getContext('webgl');</code>.

  See this

  reference for the native canvas API</a> for possible drawing functions you can
  call.</p>
