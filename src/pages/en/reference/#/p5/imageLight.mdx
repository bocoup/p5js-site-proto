  <p>Creates an image light with the given image.</p>
  <p>The image light simulates light from all the directions.
  This is done by using the image as a texture for an infinitely
  large sphere light. This sphere contains
  or encapsulates the whole scene/drawing.
  It will have different effect for varying shininess of the
  object in the drawing.
  Under the hood it is mainly doing 2 types of calculations,
  the first one is creating an irradiance map the
  environment map of the input image.
  The second one is managing reflections based on the shininess
  or roughness of the material used in the scene.</p>
  <p>Note: The image's diffuse light will be affected by fill()
  and the specular reflections will be affected by specularMaterial()
  and shininess().</p>
