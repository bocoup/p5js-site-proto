  <p>Turn off some features of the friendly error system (FES), which can give

  a significant boost to performance when needed.</p>

  <p>Note that this will disable the parts of the FES that cause performance

  slowdown (like argument checking). Friendly errors that have no performance

  cost (like giving a descriptive error if a file load fails, or warning you

  if you try to override p5.js functions in the global space),

  will remain in place.</p>
