description: >
  <p>Rotates a shape by the amount specified by the angle parameter. This

  function accounts for <a href="#/p5/angleMode">angleMode</a>, so angles

  can be entered in either RADIANS or DEGREES.</p>

  <p>Objects are always rotated around their relative position to the

  origin and positive numbers rotate objects in a clockwise direction.

  Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent

  calls to the function accumulate the effect. For example, calling

  rotate(HALF_PI) and then rotate(HALF_PI) is the same as rotate(PI).

  All transformations are reset when <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> begins
  again.</p>

  <p>Technically, <a href="#/p5/rotate">rotate()</a> multiplies the current
  transformation matrix

  by a rotation matrix. This function can be further controlled by

  <a href="#/p5/push">push()</a> and <a href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a>.</p>
