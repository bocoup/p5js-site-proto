  <p>The <code>p5()</code> constructor enables you to activate "instance mode"
  instead of normal

  "global mode". This is an advanced topic. A short description and example is

  included below. Please see

  page</a>

  for more info.</p>

  <p>By default, all p5.js functions are in the global namespace (i.e. bound to
  the window

  object), meaning you can call them simply <code>ellipse()</code>,
  <code>fill()</code>, etc. However, this

  might be inconvenient if you are mixing with other JS libraries (synchronously
  or

  asynchronously) or writing long programs of your own. p5.js currently supports
  a

  way around this problem called "instance mode". In instance mode, all p5
  functions

  are bound up in a single variable instead of polluting your global
  namespace.</p>

  <p>Optionally, you can specify a default container for the canvas and any
  other elements

  to append to with a second argument. You can give the ID of an element in your
  html,

  or an html node itself.</p>

  <p>Note that creating instances like this also allows you to have more than
  one p5 sketch on

  a single web page, as they will each be wrapped up with their own set up
  variables. Of

  course, you could also use iframes to have multiple sketches in global
  mode.</p>
