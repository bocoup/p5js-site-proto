  <p>Creates a screen reader-accessible description for shapes on the canvas.

  <code>textOutput()</code> adds a general description, list of shapes, and

  table of shapes to the web page.</p>

  <p>The general description includes the canvas size, canvas color, and number

  of shapes. For example,

  <code>Your output is a, 100 by 100 pixels, gray canvas containing the
  following 2 shapes:</code>.</p>

  <p>A list of shapes follows the general description. The list describes the

  color, location, and area of each shape. For example,

  <code>a red circle at middle covering 3% of the canvas</code>. Each shape can
  be

  selected to get more details.</p>

  <p><code>textOutput()</code> uses its table of shapes as a list. The table
  describes the

  shape, color, location, coordinates and area. For example,

  <code>red circle location = middle area = 3%</code>. This is different from

  <a href="#/p5/gridOutput">gridOutput()</a>, which uses its table as a
  grid.</p>

  <p>The <code>display</code> parameter is optional. It determines how the
  description is

  displayed. If <code>LABEL</code> is passed, as in
  <code>textOutput(LABEL)</code>, the description

  will be visible in a div element next to the canvas. Using <code>LABEL</code>
  creates

  unhelpful duplicates for screen readers. Only use <code>LABEL</code> during

  development. If <code>FALLBACK</code> is passed, as in
  <code>textOutput(FALLBACK)</code>, the

  description will only be visible to screen readers. This is the default

  mode.</p>
