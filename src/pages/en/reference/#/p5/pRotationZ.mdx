  device along the z axis in the frame previous to the current frame.
  If the sketch <a href="#/p5/angleMode"> angleMode()</a> is set to DEGREES,
  the value will be 0 to 360. If it is set to RADIANS, the value will
  be 0 to 2*PI.</p>
  <p>pRotationZ can also be used with rotationZ to determine the rotate
  direction of the device along the Z-axis.</p>
