  <p>Sets the frustum of the current camera as defined by
  the parameters.</p>
  <p>A frustum is a geometric form: a pyramid with its top
  cut off. With the viewer's eye at the imaginary top of
  the pyramid, the six planes of the frustum act as clipping
  planes when rendering a 3D view. Thus, any form inside the
  clipping planes is visible; anything outside
  those planes is not visible.</p>
  <p>Setting the frustum changes the perspective of the scene being rendered.
  This can be achieved more simply in many cases by using
  <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/perspective">perspective()</a>.</p>
  <p>If no parameters are given, the following default is used:
  frustum(-width/20, width/20, height/20, -height/20, eyeZ/10, eyeZ*10),
  where eyeZ is equal to ((height/2) / tan(PI/6)).</p>
