  <p><a href="#/p5/for">for</a> creates a loop that is useful for executing one

  section of code multiple times.</p>

  <p>A 'for loop' consists of three different expressions inside of a
  parenthesis,

  all of which are optional.These expressions are used to control the number of

  times the loop is run.The first expression is a statement that is used to set

  the initial state for the loop.The second expression is a condition that you

  would like to check before each loop. If this expression returns false then

  the loop will exit.The third expression is executed at the end of each loop.

  These expression are separated by ; (semi-colon).In case of an empty
  expression,

  only a semi-colon is written.</p>

  <p>The code inside of the loop body (in between the curly braces) is executed
  between the evaluation of the second

  and third expression.</p>

  <p>As with any loop, it is important to ensure that the loop can 'exit', or
  that

  the test condition will eventually evaluate to false. The test condition with
  a <a href="#/p5/for">for</a> loop

  is the second expression detailed above. Ensuring that this expression can
  eventually

  become false ensures that your loop doesn't attempt to run an infinite amount
  of times,

  which can crash your browser.</p>

  <p>From <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for">the
  MDN entry</a>:

  Creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition
  evaluates to false.

  The condition is evaluated after executing the statement, resulting in the
  specified statement executing at least once.</p>
