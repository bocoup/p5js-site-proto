  <p>Load a 3d model from an OBJ or STL file.</p>

  <p><a href="#/p5/loadModel">loadModel()</a> should be placed inside of <a
  href="#/p5/preload">preload()</a>.

  This allows the model to load fully before the rest of your code is run.</p>

  <p>One of the limitations of the OBJ and STL format is that it doesn't have a
  built-in

  sense of scale. This means that models exported from different programs might

  be very different sizes. If your model isn't displaying, try calling

  <a href="#/p5/loadModel">loadModel()</a> with the normalized parameter set to
  true. This will resize the

  model to a scale appropriate for p5. You can also make additional changes to

  the final size of your model with the <a href="#/p5/scale">scale()</a>
  function.</p>

  <p>Also, the support for colored STL files is not present. STL files with
  color will be

  rendered without color properties.</p>
