  <p>All drawing that follows <a href="#/p5/erase">erase()</a> will subtract

  from the canvas, revealing the web page underneath. The erased areas will

  become transparent, allowing the content behind the canvas to show through.

  The <a href="#/p5/fill">fill()</a>, <a href="#/p5/stroke">stroke()</a>, and

  <a href="#/p5/blendMode">blendMode()</a> have no effect once
  <code>erase()</code> is

  called.</p>

  <p>The <code>erase()</code> function has two optional parameters. The first
  parameter

  sets the strength of erasing by the shape's interior. A value of 0 means

  that no erasing will occur. A value of 255 means that the shape's interior

  will fully erase the content underneath. The default value is 255

  (full strength).</p>

  <p>The second parameter sets the strength of erasing by the shape's edge. A

  value of 0 means that no erasing will occur. A value of 255 means that the

  shape's edge will fully erase the content underneath. The default value is

  255 (full strength).</p>

  <p>To cancel the erasing effect, use the <a href="#/p5/noErase">noErase()</a>

  function.</p>

  <p><code>erase()</code> has no effect on drawing done with the

  <a href="#/p5/image">image()</a> and

  <a href="#/p5/background">background()</a> functions.</p>
