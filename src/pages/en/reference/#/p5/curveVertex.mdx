description: >
  <p>Specifies vertex coordinates for curves. This function may only

  be used between <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a> and <a
  href="#/p5/endShape">endShape()</a> and only when there

  is no MODE parameter specified to <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a>.

  For WebGL mode curveVertex() can be used in 2D as well as 3D mode.

  2D mode expects 2 parameters, while 3D mode expects 3 parameters.</p>

  <p>The first and last points in a series of curveVertex() lines will be used
  to

  guide the beginning and end of the curve. A minimum of four

  points is required to draw a tiny curve between the second and

  third points. Adding a fifth point with curveVertex() will draw

  the curve between the second, third, and fourth points. The

  curveVertex() function is an implementation of Catmull-Rom

  splines.</p>
