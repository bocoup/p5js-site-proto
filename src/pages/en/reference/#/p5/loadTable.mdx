description: >
  <p>Reads the contents of a file or URL and creates a <a
  href="#/p5.Table">p5.Table</a> object with

  its values. If a file is specified, it must be located in the sketch's

  "data" folder. The filename parameter can also be a URL to a file found

  online. By default, the file is assumed to be comma-separated (in CSV

  format). Table only looks for a header row if the 'header' option is

  included.</p>

  <p>This method is asynchronous, meaning it may not finish before the next

  line in your sketch is executed. Calling <a
  href="#/p5/loadTable">loadTable()</a> inside <a
  href="#/p5/preload">preload()</a>

  guarantees to complete the operation before <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a>
  and <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> are called.

  Outside of <a href="#/p5/preload">preload()</a>, you may supply a callback
  function to handle the

  object:</p>

  <p>All files loaded and saved use UTF-8 encoding. This method is suitable for
  fetching files up to size of 64MB.</p>
