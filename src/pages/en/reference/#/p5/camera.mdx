description: >
  <p>Sets the position of the current camera in a 3D sketch.

  Parameters for this function define the camera's position,

  the center of the sketch (where the camera is pointing),

  and an up direction (the orientation of the camera).</p>

  <p>This function simulates the movements of the camera, allowing objects to be

  viewed from various angles. Remember, it does not move the objects themselves

  but the camera instead. For example when the centerX value is positive,

  and the camera is rotating to the right side of the sketch,

  the object will seem like it's moving to the left.</p>

  <p>See this <a href =
  "https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/740258">example</a>

  to view the position of your camera.</p>

  <p>If no parameters are given, the following default is used:

  camera(0, 0, (height/2) / tan(PI/6), 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)</p>
