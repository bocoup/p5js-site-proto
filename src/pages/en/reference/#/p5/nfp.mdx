  <p>Utility function for formatting numbers into strings. Similar to <a
  href="#/p5/nf">nf()</a> but

  puts a "+" in front of positive numbers and a "-" in front of negative

  numbers. There are two versions: one for formatting floats, and one for

  formatting ints. The values for left, and right parameters

  should always be positive integers.</p>
