description: >
  <p>A class to describe a two or three-dimensional vector. A vector is like an

  arrow pointing in space. Vectors have both magnitude (length) and

  direction.</p>

  <p><code>p5.Vector</code> objects are often used to program motion because
  they simplify

  the math. For example, a moving ball has a position and a velocity.

  Position describes where the ball is in space. The ball's position vector

  extends from the origin to the ball's center. Velocity describes the ball's

  speed and the direction it's moving. If the ball is moving straight up, its

  velocity vector points straight up. Adding the ball's velocity vector to

  its position vector moves it, as in <code>pos.add(vel)</code>. Vector math
  relies on

  methods inside the <code>p5.Vector</code> class.</p>

lerp:
  description: >
    <p>Calculates new <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>
    components that are proportionally the

    same distance between two vectors. The <code>amt</code> parameter is the
    amount to

    interpolate between the old vector and the new vector. 0.0 keeps all

    components equal to the old vector's, 0.5 is halfway between, and 1.0 sets

    all components equal to the new vector's.</p>

    <p>The static version of <code>lerp()</code>, as in <code>p5.Vector.lerp(v0,
    v1, 0.5)</code>,

slerp:

    the new vector. 0.0 keeps the heading and magnitude equal to the old

    vector's, 0.5 sets them halfway between, and 1.0 sets the heading and

    magnitude equal to the new vector's.</p>

    <p><code>slerp()</code> differs from <a href="#/p5.Vector/lerp">lerp()</a>
    because

    it interpolates magnitude. Calling <code>v0.slerp(v1, 0.5)</code> sets
    <code>v0</code>'s

    magnitude to a value halfway between its original magnitude and
    <code>v1</code>'s.

    Calling <code>v0.lerp(v1, 0.5)</code> makes no such guarantee.</p>

    <p>The static version of <code>slerp()</code>, as in

    <p>The version of <code>equals()</code> with multiple parameters interprets
