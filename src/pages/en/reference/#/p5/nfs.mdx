  <p>Utility function for formatting numbers into strings. Similar to <a
  href="#/p5/nf">nf()</a> but

  puts an additional "_" (space) in front of positive numbers just in case to
  align it with negative

  numbers which includes "-" (minus) sign.</p>

  <p>The main usecase of nfs() can be seen when one wants to align the digits
  (place values) of a non-negative

  number with some negative number (See the example to get a clear picture).

  There are two versions: one for formatting float, and one for formatting
  int.</p>

  <p>The values for the digits, left, and right parameters should always be
  positive integers.</p>

  <p>(IMP): The result on the canvas basically the expected alignment can vary
  based on the typeface you are using.</p>

  <p>(NOTE): Be cautious when using left and right parameters as it prepends
  numbers of 0's if the parameter

  if greater than the current length of the number.</p>

  <p>For example if number is 123.2 and left parameter passed is 4 which is
  greater than length of 123

  (integer part) i.e 3 than result will be 0123.2. Same case for right parameter
  i.e. if right is 3 than

  the result will be 123.200.</p>
