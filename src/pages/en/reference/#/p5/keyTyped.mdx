  <p>The <a href="#/p5/keyTyped">keyTyped()</a> function is called once every
  time a key is pressed, but

  action keys such as Backspace, Delete, Ctrl, Shift, and Alt are ignored. If
  you are trying to detect

  a keyCode for one of these keys, use the <a
  href="#/p5/keyPressed">keyPressed()</a> function instead.

  The most recent key typed will be stored in the key variable.</p>

  <p>Because of how operating systems handle key repeats, holding down a key

  will cause multiple calls to <a href="#/p5/keyTyped">keyTyped()</a> (and <a
  href="#/p5/keyReleased">keyReleased()</a> as well). The

  rate of repeat is set by the operating system and how each computer is

  configured.<br><br>

  Browsers may have different default behaviors attached to various key

  events. To prevent any default behavior for this event, add "return false"

  to the end of the function.</p>
