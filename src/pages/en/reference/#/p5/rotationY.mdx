  <p>The system variable rotationY always contains the rotation of the
  device along the y axis. If the sketch <a href="#/p5/angleMode">
  angleMode()</a> is set to DEGREES, the value will be -90 to 90. If
  it is set to RADIANS, the value will be -PI/2 to PI/2.</p>
  <p>Note: The order the rotations are called is important, ie. if used
  together, it must be called in the order Z-X-Y or there might be
  unexpected behaviour.</p>
