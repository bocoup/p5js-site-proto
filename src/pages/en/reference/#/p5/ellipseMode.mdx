  <p>Modifies the location from which ellipses, circles, and arcs are drawn. By
  default, the

  first two parameters are the x- and y-coordinates of the shape's center. The
  next

  parameters are its width and height. This is equivalent to calling
  <code>ellipseMode(CENTER)</code>.</p>

  <p><code>ellipseMode(RADIUS)</code> also uses the first two parameters to set
  the x- and y-coordinates

  of the shape's center. The next parameters are half of the shapes's width and
  height.

  Calling <code>ellipse(0, 0, 10, 15)</code> draws a shape with a width of 20
  and height of 30.</p>

  <p><code>ellipseMode(CORNER)</code> uses the first two parameters as the
  upper-left corner of the

  shape. The next parameters are its width and height.</p>

  <p><code>ellipseMode(CORNERS)</code> uses the first two parameters as the
  location of one corner

  of the ellipse's bounding box. The third and fourth parameters are the
  location of the

  opposite corner.</p>

  <p>The argument passed to <code>ellipseMode()</code> must be written in ALL
  CAPS because the constants

  <code>CENTER</code>, <code>RADIUS</code>, <code>CORNER</code>, and
  <code>CORNERS</code> are defined this way. JavaScript is a

  case-sensitive language.</p>
