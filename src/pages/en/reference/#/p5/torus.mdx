  <p>Draw a torus with given radius and tube radius</p>

  <p>DetailX and detailY determine the number of subdivisions in the x-dimension
  and

  the y-dimension of a torus. More subdivisions make the torus appear to be
  smoother.

  The default and maximum values for detailX and detailY are 24 and 16,
  respectively.

  Setting them to relatively small values like 4 and 6 allows you to create new

  shapes other than a torus.</p>
