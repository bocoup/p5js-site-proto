  <p>Stops p5.js from continuously executing the code within <a
  href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>.

  If <a href="#/p5/loop">loop()</a> is called, the code in <a
  href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>

  begins to run continuously again. If using <a href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a>

  in <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a>, it should be the last line inside the
  block.</p>

  <p>When <a href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a> is used, it's not possible to
  manipulate

  or access the screen inside event handling functions such as

  <a href="#/p5/mousePressed">mousePressed()</a> or

  <a href="#/p5/keyPressed">keyPressed()</a>. Instead, use those functions to

  call <a href="#/p5/redraw">redraw()</a> or <a href="#/p5/loop">loop()</a>,

  which will run <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>, which can update the screen

  properly. This means that when <a href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a> has been

  called, no drawing can happen, and functions like <a
  href="#/p5/saveFrames">saveFrames()</a>

  or <a href="#/p5/loadPixels">loadPixels()</a> may not be used.</p>

  <p>Note that if the sketch is resized, <a href="#/p5/redraw">redraw()</a> will

  be called to update the sketch, even after <a href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a>

  has been specified. Otherwise, the sketch would enter an odd state until

  <a href="#/p5/loop">loop()</a> was called.</p>

  <p>Use <a href="#/p5/isLooping">isLooping()</a> to check the current state of
  <a href="#/p5/loop">loop()</a>.</p>
