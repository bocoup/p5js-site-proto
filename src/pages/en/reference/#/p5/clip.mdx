  <p>Use the shape drawn by a callback function to mask subsequent things drawn
  to the canvas.

  Only opaque regions of the mask shape will allow content to be drawn.</p>

  <p>The mask will apply to anything drawn after this call. To draw without a
  mask, contain

  the code to apply the mask and to draw the masked content between

  <a href="#/p5/push">push()</a> and <a href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a>.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, rather than drawing the mask shape in a function, draw the

  shape between <a href="#/p5/beginClip">beginClip()</a> and <a
  href="#/p5/endClip">endClip()</a>.</p>

  <p>Options can include:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><code>invert</code>: A boolean specifying whether or not to mask the areas
  <em>not</em> filled by the mask shape. Defaults to false.</li>

  </ul>
