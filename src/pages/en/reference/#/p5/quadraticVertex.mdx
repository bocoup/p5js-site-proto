description: >
  <p>Specifies vertex coordinates for quadratic Bezier curves. Each call to

  quadraticVertex() defines the position of one control points and one

  anchor point of a Bezier curve, adding a new segment to a line or shape.

  The first time quadraticVertex() is used within a <a
  href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a> call, it

  must be prefaced with a call to <a href="#/p5/vertex">vertex()</a> to set the
  first anchor point.

  For WebGL mode quadraticVertex() can be used in 2D as well as 3D mode.

  2D mode expects 4 parameters, while 3D mode expects 6 parameters

  (including z coordinates).</p>

  <p>This function must be used between <a
  href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a> and <a
  href="#/p5/endShape">endShape()</a>

  and only when there is no MODE or POINTS parameter specified to

  <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a>.</p>
