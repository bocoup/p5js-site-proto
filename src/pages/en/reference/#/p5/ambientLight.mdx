  <p>Creates an ambient light with the given color.</p>
  <p>Ambient light does not come from a specific direction.
  Objects are evenly lit from all sides. Ambient lights are
  almost always used in combination with other types of lights.</p>
  <p>Note: lights need to be called (whether directly or indirectly)
  within draw() to remain persistent in a looping program.
  Placing them in setup() will cause them to only have an effect
  the first time through the loop.</p>
