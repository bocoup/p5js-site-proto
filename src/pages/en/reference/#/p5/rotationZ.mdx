  <p>The system variable rotationZ always contains the rotation of the
  device along the z axis. If the sketch <a href="#/p5/angleMode">
  angleMode()</a> is set to DEGREES, the value will be 0 to 360. If
  it is set to RADIANS, the value will be 0 to 2*PI.</p>
  <p>Unlike rotationX and rotationY, this variable is available for devices
  with a built-in compass only.</p>
  <p>Note: The order the rotations are called is important, ie. if used
  together, it must be called in the order Z-X-Y or there might be
  unexpected behaviour.</p>
