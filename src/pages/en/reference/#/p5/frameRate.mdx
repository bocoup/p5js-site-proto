  <p>Sets the number of frames to draw per second.</p>

  <p>Calling <code>frameRate()</code> with one numeric argument, as in
  <code>frameRate(30)</code>,

  attempts to draw 30 frames per second (FPS). The target frame rate may not

  be achieved depending on the sketch's processing needs. Most computers

  default to a frame rate of 60 FPS. Frame rates of 24 FPS and above are

  fast enough for smooth animations.</p>

  <p>Calling <code>frameRate()</code> without an argument returns the current
  frame rate.

  The value returned is an approximation.</p>
