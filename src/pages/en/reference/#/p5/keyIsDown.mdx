  <p>The <a href="#/p5/keyIsDown">keyIsDown()</a> function checks if the key is
  currently down, i.e. pressed.

  It can be used if you have an object that moves, and you want several keys

  to be able to affect its behaviour simultaneously, such as moving a

  sprite diagonally. You can put in any number representing the keyCode of

  the key, or use any of the variable <a href="#/p5/keyCode">keyCode</a> names
  listed

  <a href="http://p5js.org/reference/#p5/keyCode">here</a>.</p>
