description: >
  <p>Returns the dot product of two vectors. The dot product is a number that

  describes the overlap between two vectors. Visually, the dot product can be

  thought of as the "shadow" one vector casts on another. The dot product's

  magnitude is largest when two vectors point in the same or opposite

  directions. Its magnitude is 0 when two vectors form a right angle.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>dot()</code> with one parameter interprets it as
  another

  <a href="#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>dot()</code> with multiple parameters interprets them
  as the

  <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> components of another
  vector.</p>

  <p>The static version of <code>dot()</code>, as in <code>p5.Vector.dot(v1,
  v2)</code>, is the same

  as calling <code>v1.dot(v2)</code>.</p>
