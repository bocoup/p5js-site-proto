description: >
  <p>Returns the distance between two points represented by vectors. A point's

  coordinates can be thought of as a vector's components.</p>

  <p>The static version of <code>dist()</code>, as in <code>p5.Vector.dist(v1,
  v2)</code>, is the same

  as calling <code>v1.dist(v2)</code>.</p>

  <p>Use <a href="#/p5/dist">dist()</a> to calculate the distance between points

  using coordinates as in <code>dist(x1, y1, x2, y2)</code>.</p>
