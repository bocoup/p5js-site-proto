description: >
  <p>Calculates a new heading and magnitude that are between two vectors. The

  <code>amt</code> parameter is the amount to interpolate between the old vector
  and

  the new vector. 0.0 keeps the heading and magnitude equal to the old

  vector's, 0.5 sets them halfway between, and 1.0 sets the heading and

  magnitude equal to the new vector's.</p>

  <p><code>slerp()</code> differs from <a href="#/p5.Vector/lerp">lerp()</a>
  because

  it interpolates magnitude. Calling <code>v0.slerp(v1, 0.5)</code> sets
  <code>v0</code>'s

  magnitude to a value halfway between its original magnitude and
  <code>v1</code>'s.

  Calling <code>v0.lerp(v1, 0.5)</code> makes no such guarantee.</p>

  <p>The static version of <code>slerp()</code>, as in <code>p5.Vector.slerp(v0,
  v1, 0.5)</code>,

  returns a new <a href="#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object and doesn't change

  the original.</p>
