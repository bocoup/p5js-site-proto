  <p>Returns an array of amplitude values (between 0 and 255)
  across the frequency spectrum. Length is equal to FFT bins
  (1024 by default). The array indices correspond to frequencies
  (i.e. pitches), from the lowest to the highest that humans can
  hear. Each value represents amplitude at that slice of the
  frequency spectrum. Must be called prior to using
  <code>getEnergy()</code>.</p>

      <p>Must be a power of two between
                                 16 and 1024. Defaults to 1024.</p>

      <p>If "dB," returns decibel

                                 -140 and 0 (max).
                                 Otherwise returns integers from 0-255.</p>
