descriptionText: >-
  The <a href="#/p5/keyPressed">keyPressed()</a> function is called once every
  time a key is pressed. The

  keyCode for the key that was pressed is stored in the <a
  href="#/p5/keyCode">keyCode</a> variable.For non-ASCII keys, use the keyCode
  variable. You can check if the keyCode

  equals BACKSPACE, DELETE, ENTER, RETURN, TAB, ESCAPE, SHIFT, CONTROL,

  OPTION, ALT, UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW, LEFT_ARROW, RIGHT_ARROW.For ASCII keys, the
  key that was pressed is stored in the key variable. However, it

  does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase. For this reason, it

  is recommended to use <a href="#/p5/keyTyped">keyTyped()</a> to read the key
  variable, in which the

  case of the variable will be distinguished.Because of how operating systems
  handle key repeats, holding down a key

  may cause multiple calls to <a href="#/p5/keyTyped">keyTyped()</a> (and <a
  href="#/p5/keyReleased">keyReleased()</a> as well). The

  rate of repeat is set by the operating system and how each computer is

  configured.<br><br>

  Browsers may have different default

  behaviors attached to various key events. To prevent any default

  behavior for this event, add "return false" to the end of the method.
