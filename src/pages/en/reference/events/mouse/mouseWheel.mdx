descriptionText: >-
  The function <a href="#/p5/mouseWheel">mouseWheel()</a> is executed every time
  a vertical mouse wheel

  event is detected either triggered by an actual mouse wheel or by a

  touchpad.<br><br>

  The event.delta property returns the amount the mouse wheel

  have scrolled. The values can be positive or negative depending on the

  scroll direction (on macOS with "natural" scrolling enabled, the signs

  are inverted).<br><br>

  Browsers may have different default behaviors attached to various

  mouse events. To prevent any default behavior for this event, add

  "return false" to the end of the method.<br><br>

  Due to the current support of the "wheel" event on Safari, the function

  may only work as expected if "return false" is included while using Safari.
