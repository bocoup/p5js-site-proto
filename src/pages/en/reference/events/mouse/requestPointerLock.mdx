  The function <a href="#/p5/requestPointerLock">requestPointerLock()</a>

  locks the pointer to its current position and makes it invisible.

  Use <a href="#/p5/movedX">movedX</a> and <a href="#/p5/movedY">movedY</a> to
  get the difference the mouse was moved since

  the last call of draw.

  Note that not all browsers support this feature.

  This enables you to create experiences that aren't limited by the mouse moving
  out of the screen

  even if it is repeatedly moved into one direction.

  For example, a first person perspective experience.
