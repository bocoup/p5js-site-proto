  This function is used to apply a regular expression to a piece of text,

  and return a list of matching groups (elements found inside parentheses)

  as a two-dimensional String array. If there are no matches, a null value

  will be returned. If no groups are specified in the regular expression,

  but the sequence matches, a two dimensional array is still returned, but

  the second dimension is only of length one.To use the function, first check to
  see if the result is null. If the

  result is null, then the sequence did not match at all. If the sequence

  did match, a 2D array is returned.If there are groups (specified by sets of
  parentheses) in the regular

  expression, then the contents of each will be returned in the array.

  Assuming a loop with counter variable i, element [i][0] of a regular

  expression match returns the entire matching string, and the match groups

  start at element [i][1] (the first group is [i][1], the second [i][2],

  and so on).
