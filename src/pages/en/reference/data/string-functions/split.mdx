  <p>The <a href="#/p5/split">split()</a> function maps to String.split(), it
  breaks a String into

  pieces using a character or string as the delimiter. The delim parameter

  specifies the character or characters that mark the boundaries between

  each piece. A String[] array is returned that contains each of the pieces.</p>

  <p>The <a href="#/p5/splitTokens">splitTokens()</a> function works in a
  similar fashion, except that it

  splits using a range of characters instead of a specific character or

  sequence.</p>
