  <p>Run a function while drawing to the framebuffer rather than to its canvas.

  This is equivalent to calling <code>framebuffer.begin()</code>, running the
  function,

  and then calling <code>framebuffer.end()</code>, but ensures that one never

  accidentally forgets <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code>.</p>

      <p>A function to run that draws to the canvas. The
