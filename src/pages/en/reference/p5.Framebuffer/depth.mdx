description: >
  <p>A texture with the depth information of the framebuffer. If the framebuffer

  was created with <code>{ depth: false }</code> in its settings, then this
  property will

  be undefined. Pass this to <a href="#/p5/texture">texture()</a> to draw it to

  the canvas, or pass it to a shader with

  <a href="#/p5.Shader/setUniform">setUniform()</a> to read its data.</p>

  <p>Since Framebuffers are controlled by WebGL, their y coordinates are stored

  flipped compared to images and videos. When texturing with a framebuffer

  texture, you may want to flip vertically, e.g. with

  <code>plane(framebuffer.width, -framebuffer.height)</code>.</p>
