descriptionText: >
  <p>Increases or decreases the size of a shape by expanding or contracting

  vertices. Objects always scale from their relative origin to the

  coordinate system. Scale values are specified as decimal percentages.

  For example, the function call scale(2.0) increases the dimension of a

  shape by 200%.</p>

  <p>Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent

  calls to the function multiply the effect. For example, calling scale(2.0)

  and then scale(1.5) is the same as scale(3.0). If <a
  href="#/p5/scale">scale()</a> is called

  within <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>, the transformation is reset when the
  loop begins again.</p>

  <p>Using this function with the z parameter is only available in WEBGL mode.

  This function can be further controlled with <a href="#/p5/push">push()</a>
  and <a href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a>.</p>
