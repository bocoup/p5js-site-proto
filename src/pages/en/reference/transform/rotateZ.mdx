  <p>Rotates a shape around Z axis by the amount specified in angle parameter.

  The angles can be entered in either RADIANS or DEGREES.</p>

  <p>This method works in WEBGL mode only.</p>

  <p>Objects are always rotated around their relative position to the

  origin and positive numbers rotate objects in a clockwise direction.

  All transformations are reset when <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> begins
