  <p>A phrase is a pattern of musical events over time, i.e.
  a series of notes and rests.</p>

  <p>Phrases must be added to a p5.Part for playback, and
  each part can play multiple phrases at the same time.
  For example, one Phrase might be a kick drum, another
  could be a snare, and another could be the bassline.</p>

  <p>The first parameter is a name so that the phrase can be
  modified or deleted later. The callback is a a function that
  this phrase will call at every stepâ€”for example it might be
  called <code>playNote(value){}</code>. The array determines
  which value is passed into the callback at each step of the
  phrase. It can be numbers, an object with multiple numbers,
  or a zero (0) indicates a rest so the callback won't be called).</p>

      <p>The name of a function that this phrase
                                 will call. Typically it will play a sound,
                                 and accept two parameters: a time at which
                                 to play the sound (in seconds from now),
                                 and a value from the sequence array. The
                                 time should be passed into the play() or
                                 start() method to ensure precision.</p>
