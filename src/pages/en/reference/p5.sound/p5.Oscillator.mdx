title: p5.Oscillator
module: p5.sound
submodule: p5.sound
file: lib/addons/p5.sound.js
description: |-
  <p>Creates a signal that oscillates between -1.0 and 1.0.
  By default, the oscillation takes the form of a sinusoidal
  shape ('sine'). Additional types include 'triangle',
  'sawtooth' and 'square'. The frequency defaults to
  440 oscillations per second (440Hz, equal to the pitch of an
  'A' note).</p>

  <p>Set the type of oscillation with setType(), or by instantiating a
  specific oscillator: <a href="/reference/#/p5.SinOsc">p5.SinOsc</a>, <a
  href="/reference/#/p5.TriOsc">p5.TriOsc</a>, <a
  href="/reference/#/p5.SqrOsc">p5.SqrOsc</a>, or <a
  href="/reference/#/p5.SawOsc">p5.SawOsc</a>.
