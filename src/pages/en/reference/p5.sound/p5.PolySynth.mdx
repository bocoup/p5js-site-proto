  <p>An AudioVoice is used as a single voice for sound synthesis.
  The PolySynth class holds an array of AudioVoice, and deals
  with voices allocations, with setting notes to be played, and
  parameters to be set.</p>

  notes:
    description: >
      <p>An object that holds information about which notes have been played and

      which notes are currently being played. New notes are added as keys

      on the fly. While a note has been attacked, but not released, the value of
      the

      key is the audiovoice which is generating that note. When notes are
      released,

      the value of the key becomes undefined.</p>

      <p>A PolySynth must have at least 1 voice, defaults to 8</p>

  AudioVoice:
    description: |
      <p>Monosynth that generates the sound for each note that is triggered. The
      p5.PolySynth defaults to using the p5.MonoSynth as its voice.</p>
    path: ../p5.PolySynth/AudioVoice
  play:
    description: >
      <p>Play a note by triggering noteAttack and noteRelease with sustain
      time</p>
    path: ../p5.PolySynth/play
  noteADSR:
    description: >
      <p>noteADSR sets the envelope for a specific note that has just been
      triggered.

      Using this method modifies the envelope of whichever audiovoice is being
      used

      to play the desired note. The envelope should be reset before noteRelease
      is called

      in order to prevent the modified envelope from being used on other
      notes.</p>
    path: ../p5.PolySynth/noteADSR
  setADSR:
    description: >
      <p>Set the PolySynths global envelope. This method modifies the envelopes
      of each

      monosynth so that all notes are played with this envelope.</p>
    path: ../p5.PolySynth/setADSR
  noteAttack:
    description: |
      <p>Trigger the Attack, and Decay portion of a MonoSynth.
      Similar to holding down a key on a piano, but it will
      hold the sustain level until you let go.</p>
    path: ../p5.PolySynth/noteAttack
  noteRelease:
    description: |
      <p>Trigger the Release of an AudioVoice note. This is similar to releasing
      the key on a piano and letting the sound fade according to the
      release level and release time.</p>
