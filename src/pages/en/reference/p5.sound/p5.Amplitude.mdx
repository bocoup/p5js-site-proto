  <p>Amplitude measures volume between 0.0 and 1.0.
  Listens to all p5sound by default, or use setInput()
  to listen to a specific sound source. Accepts an optional
  smoothing value, which defaults to 0.</p>

      <p>Connects to the p5sound instance (main output) by default.
      Optionally, you can pass in a specific source (i.e. a soundfile).</p>

      <p>Returns a single Amplitude reading at the moment it is called.
      For continuous readings, run in the draw loop.</p>

  toggleNormalize:
    description: |
      <p>Determines whether the results of Amplitude.process() will be
      Normalized. To normalize, Amplitude finds the difference the
      loudest reading it has processed and the maximum amplitude of
      1.0. Amplitude adds this difference to all values to produce
      results that will reliably map between 0.0 and 1.0. However,
      if a louder moment occurs, the amount that Normalize adds to
      all the values will change. Accepts an optional boolean parameter
      (true or false). Normalizing is off by default.</p>

      <p>Smooth Amplitude analysis by averaging with the last analysis
      frame. Off by default.</p>
