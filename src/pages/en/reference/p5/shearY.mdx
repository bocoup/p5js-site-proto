  <p>Shears a shape around the y-axis the amount specified by the angle

  parameter. Angles should be specified in the current angleMode. Objects

  are always sheared around their relative position to the origin and

  positive numbers shear objects in a clockwise direction.</p>

  <p>Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent

  calls to the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling

  shearY(PI/2) and then shearY(PI/2) is the same as shearY(PI). If

  <a href="#/p5/shearY">shearY()</a> is called within the <a
  href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>, the transformation is reset when

  the loop begins again.</p>

  <p>Technically, <a href="#/p5/shearY">shearY()</a> multiplies the current
  transformation matrix by a

  rotation matrix. This function can be further controlled by the

  <a href="#/p5/push">push()</a> and <a href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a> functions.</p>
