description: >
  <p>Specifies vertex coordinates for Bezier curves. Each call to

  bezierVertex() defines the position of two control points and

  one anchor point of a Bezier curve, adding a new segment to a

  line or shape. For WebGL mode bezierVertex() can be used in 2D

  as well as 3D mode. 2D mode expects 6 parameters, while 3D mode

  expects 9 parameters (including z coordinates).</p>

  <p>The first time bezierVertex() is used within a <a
  href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a>

  call, it must be prefaced with a call to <a href="#/p5/vertex">vertex()</a> to
  set the first anchor

  point. This function must be used between <a
  href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a> and <a
  href="#/p5/endShape">endShape()</a>

  and only when there is no MODE or POINTS parameter specified to

  <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a>.</p>
