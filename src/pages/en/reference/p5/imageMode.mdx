  <p>Changes the location from which images are drawn when

  <a href="#/p5/image">image()</a> is called.</p>

  <p>By default, the first

  two parameters of <a href="#/p5/image">image()</a> are the x- and

  y-coordinates of the image's upper-left corner. The next parameters are

  its width and height. This is the same as calling
  <code>imageMode(CORNER)</code>.</p>

  <p><code>imageMode(CORNERS)</code> also uses the first two parameters of

  <a href="#/p5/image">image()</a> as the x- and y-coordinates of the image's

  top-left corner. The third and fourth parameters are the coordinates of its

  bottom-right corner.</p>

  <p><code>imageMode(CENTER)</code> uses the first two parameters of

  <a href="#/p5/image">image()</a> as the x- and y-coordinates of the image's

  center. The next parameters are its width and height.</p>
