  <p>An object that one can draw to and then read as a texture. While similar
  to a p5.Graphics, using a p5.Framebuffer as a texture will generally run
  much faster, as it lives within the same WebGL context as the canvas it
  is created on. It only works in WebGL mode.</p>

      containing the values for all the pixels in the Framebuffer.</p>

      <p>Like the <a href="#/p5/pixels">main canvas pixels property</a>, call

      <a href="#/p5.Framebuffer/loadPixels">loadPixels()</a> before reading

      it, and call <a href="#/p5.Framebuffer.updatePixels">updatePixels()</a>

      afterwards to update its data.</p>

      <p>Note that updating pixels via this property will be slower than

      <a href="#/p5.Framebuffer/begin">drawing to the framebuffer directly.</a>

      Consider using a shader instead of looping over pixels.</p>

  pixelDensity:
    description: |
      <p>Gets or sets the pixel scaling for high pixel density displays. By
      default, the density will match that of the canvas the framebuffer was
      created on, which will match the display density.</p>
      <p>Call this method with no arguments to get the current density, or pass
      in a number to set the density.</p>

  autoSized:
    description: >
      <p>Gets or sets whether or not this framebuffer will automatically resize

      along with the canvas it's attached to in order to match its size.</p>

      <p>Call this method with no arguments to see if it is currently
      auto-sized,

      or pass in a boolean to set this property.</p>

  createCamera:
    description: |
      <p>Creates and returns a new
      <a href="#/p5.FramebufferCamera">p5.FramebufferCamera</a> to be used
      while drawing to this framebuffer. The camera will be set as the

  begin:
    description: |
      <p>Begin drawing to this framebuffer. Subsequent drawing functions to the
      canvas the framebuffer is attached to will not be immediately visible, and
      will instead be drawn to the framebuffer's texture. Call
      <a href="#/p5.Framebuffer/end">end()</a> when finished to make draw
      functions go right to the canvas again and to be able to read the
      contents of the framebuffer's texture.</p>

      <p>After having previously called
      <a href="#/p5.Framebuffer/begin">begin()</a>, this method stops drawing
      functions from going to the framebuffer's texture, allowing them to go
      right to the canvas again. After this, one can read from the framebuffer's
      texture.</p>

  draw:
    description: >
      <p>Run a function while drawing to the framebuffer rather than to its
      canvas.

      This is equivalent to calling <code>framebuffer.begin()</code>, running
      the function,

      and then calling <code>framebuffer.end()</code>, but ensures that one
      never

      accidentally forgets <code>begin</code> or <code>end</code>.</p>

  get:
    description: >
      <p>Get a region of pixels from the canvas in the form of a

      <a href="#/p5.Image">p5.Image</a>, or a single pixel as an array of

      numbers.</p>

      <p>Returns an array of [R,G,B,A] values for any pixel or grabs a section
      of

      an image. If the Framebuffer has been set up to not store alpha values,
      then

      only [R,G,B] will be returned. If no parameters are specified, the entire

      image is returned.

      Use the x and y parameters to get the value of one pixel. Get a section of

      the display window by specifying additional w and h parameters. When

      getting an image, the x and y parameters define the coordinates for the

      upper-left corner of the image, regardless of the current <a
      href="#/p5/imageMode">imageMode()</a>.</p>
    path: ../p5.Framebuffer/get
  color:
    description: >
      <p>A texture with the color information of the framebuffer. Pass this (or
      the

      framebuffer itself) to <a href="#/p5/texture">texture()</a> to draw it to

      the canvas, or pass it to a shader with

      <a href="#/p5.Shader/setUniform">setUniform()</a> to read its data.</p>

      <p>Since Framebuffers are controlled by WebGL, their y coordinates are
      stored

      flipped compared to images and videos. When texturing with a framebuffer

      texture, you may want to flip vertically, e.g. with

      <code>plane(framebuffer.width, -framebuffer.height)</code>.</p>
    path: ../p5.Framebuffer/color
  depth:
    description: >
      <p>A texture with the depth information of the framebuffer. If the
      framebuffer

      was created with <code>{ depth: false }</code> in its settings, then this
      property will

      be undefined. Pass this to <a href="#/p5/texture">texture()</a> to draw it
      to

      the canvas, or pass it to a shader with

      <a href="#/p5.Shader/setUniform">setUniform()</a> to read its data.</p>
