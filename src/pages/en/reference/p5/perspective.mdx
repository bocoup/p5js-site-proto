description: |
  <p>Sets a perspective projection for the current camera in a 3D sketch.
  This projection represents depth through foreshortening: objects
  that are close to the camera appear their actual size while those
  that are further away from the camera appear smaller.</p>
  <p>The parameters to this function define the viewing frustum
  (the truncated pyramid within which objects are seen by the camera) through
  vertical field of view, aspect ratio (usually width/height), and near and far
  clipping planes.</p>
  <p>If no parameters are given, the following default is used:
  perspective(PI/3, width/height, eyeZ/10, eyeZ*10),
  where eyeZ is equal to ((height/2) / tan(PI/6)).</p>
