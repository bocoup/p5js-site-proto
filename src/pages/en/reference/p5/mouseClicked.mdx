  <p>The <a href="#/p5/mouseClicked">mouseClicked()</a> function is called once
  after a mouse button has been

  pressed and then released.<br><br>

  Browsers handle clicks differently, so this function is only guaranteed to be

  run when the left mouse button is clicked. To handle other mouse buttons

  being pressed or released, see <a href="#/p5/mousePressed">mousePressed()</a>
  or <a href="#/p5/mouseReleased">mouseReleased()</a>.<br><br>

  Browsers may have different default

  behaviors attached to various mouse events. To prevent any default

  behavior for this event, add "return false" to the end of the function.</p>
