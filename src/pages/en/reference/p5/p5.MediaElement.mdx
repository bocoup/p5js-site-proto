  <p>A class to handle audio and video.</p>

  <p><code>p5.MediaElement</code> extends <a href="#/p5.Element">p5.Element</a>
  with

  methods to handle audio and video. <code>p5.MediaElement</code> objects are
  created by

  calling <a href="#/p5/createVideo">createVideo</a>,

  <a href="#/p5/createAudio">createAudio</a>, and

  <a href="#/p5/createCapture">createCapture</a>.</p>

  src:
    description: |
      <p>Path to the media element's source as a string.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/src
  play:
    description: |
      <p>Play audio or video from a media element.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/play
  stop:
    description: >
      <p>Stops a media element and sets its current time to zero. Calling

      <code>media.play()</code> will restart playing audio/video from the
      beginning.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/stop
  pause:
    description: >
      <p>Pauses a media element. Calling <code>media.play()</code> will resume
      playing

      audio/video from the moment it paused.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/pause
  loop:
    description: |
      <p>Play the audio/video repeatedly in a loop.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/loop
  noLoop:
    description: |
      <p>Stops the audio/video from playing in a loop. It will stop when it
      reaches the end.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/noLoop
  autoplay:
    description: >
      <p>Sets the audio/video to play once it's loaded.</p>

      <p>The parameter, <code>shouldAutoplay</code>, is optional. Calling

      <code>media.autoplay()</code> without an argument causes the media to play

      automatically. If <code>true</code> is passed, as in
      <code>media.autoplay(true)</code>, the

      media will automatically play. If <code>false</code> is passed, as in

      <code>media.autoPlay(false)</code>, it won't play automatically.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/autoplay
  volume:
    description: >
      <p>Manages the audio/video volume.</p>

      <p>Calling <code>media.volume()</code> without an argument returns the
      current volume

      as a number in the range 0 (off) to 1 (maximum).</p>

      <p>The parameter, <code>val</code>, is optional. It's a number that sets
      the volume

      from 0 (off) to 1 (maximum). For example, calling
      <code>media.volume(0.5)</code>

      sets the volume to half of its maximum.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/volume
  speed:
    description: >
      <p>Manages the audio/video playback speed. Calling
      <code>media.speed()</code> returns

      the current speed as a number.</p>

      <p>The parameter, <code>val</code>, is optional. It's a number that sets
      the playback

      speed. 1 plays the media at normal speed, 0.5 plays it at half speed, 2

      plays it at double speed, and so on. -1 plays the media at normal speed

      in reverse.</p>

      <p>Note: Not all browsers support backward playback. Even if they do,

      playback might not be smooth.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/speed
  time:
    description: >
      <p>Manages the media element's playback time. Calling
      <code>media.time()</code>

      returns the number of seconds the audio/video has played. Time resets to

      0 when the looping media restarts.</p>

      <p>The parameter, <code>time</code>, is optional. It's a number that
      specifies the

      time, in seconds, to jump to when playback begins.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/time
  duration:
    description: |
      <p>Returns the audio/video's duration in seconds.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/duration
  onended:
    description: >
      <p>Calls a function when the audio/video reaches the end of its playback

      The function won't be called if the media is looping.</p>

      <p>The <code>p5.MediaElement</code> is passed as an argument to the
      callback function.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/onended
  connect:
    description: |
      <p>Send the audio output of this element to a specified audioNode or
      p5.sound object. If no element is provided, connects to p5's main
      output. That connection is established when this method is first called.
      All connections are removed by the .disconnect() method.</p>
      <p>This method is meant to be used with the p5.sound.js addon library.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/connect
  disconnect:
    description: |
      <p>Disconnect all Web Audio routing, including to main output.
      This is useful if you want to re-route the output through
      audio effects, for example.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/disconnect
  showControls:
    description: >
      <p>Show the default

      <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement"
      target="_blank">HTMLMediaElement</a>

      controls. These vary between web browser.</p>

  addCue:
    description: >
      <p>Schedules a function to call when the audio/video reaches a specific
      time

      during its playback.</p>

      <p>The first parameter, <code>time</code>, is the time, in seconds, when
      the function

      should run. This value is passed to <code>callback</code> as its first
      argument.</p>

      <p>The second parameter, <code>callback</code>, is the function to call at
      the specified

      cue time.</p>

      <p>The third parameter, <code>value</code>, is optional and can be any
      type of value.

      <code>value</code> is passed to <code>callback</code>.</p>

      <p>Calling <code>media.addCue()</code> returns an ID as a string. This is
      useful for

      removing the cue later.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/addCue
  removeCue:
    description: |
      <p>Remove a callback based on its ID.</p>
    path: ../p5.MediaElement/removeCue
  clearCues:
    description: |
      <p>Removes all functions scheduled with <code>media.addCue()</code>.</p>
