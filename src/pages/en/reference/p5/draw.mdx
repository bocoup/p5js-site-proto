  <p>Called directly after <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a>, the <a
  href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> function continuously executes

  the lines of code contained inside its block until the program is stopped

  or <a href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a> is called. Note if <a
  href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a> is called in <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a>,
  <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> will

  still be executed once before stopping. <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> is
  called automatically and

  should never be called explicitly.</p>

  <p>It should always be controlled with <a href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a>, <a
  href="#/p5/redraw">redraw()</a> and <a href="#/p5/loop">loop()</a>. After

  <a href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a> stops the code in <a
  href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> from executing, <a href="#/p5/redraw">redraw()</a>
  causes the

  code inside <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> to execute once, and <a
  href="#/p5/loop">loop()</a> will cause the code

  inside <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> to resume executing continuously.</p>

  <p>The number of times <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> executes in each second
  may be controlled with

  the <a href="#/p5/frameRate">frameRate()</a> function.</p>

  <p>There can only be one <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> function for each
  sketch, and <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> must

  exist if you want the code to run continuously, or to process events such

  as <a href="#/p5/mousePressed">mousePressed()</a>. Sometimes, you might have
  an empty call to <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> in

  your program, as shown in the above example.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that the drawing coordinate system will be reset

  at the beginning of each <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> call. If any
  transformations are performed

  within <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> (ex: scale, rotate, translate), their
  effects will be

  undone at the beginning of <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>, so transformations
  will not accumulate

  over time. On the other hand, styling applied (ex: fill, stroke, etc) will

  remain in effect.</p>
