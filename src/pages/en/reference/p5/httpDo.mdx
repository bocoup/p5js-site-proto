  <p>Method for executing an HTTP request. If data type is not specified,

  p5 will try to guess based on the URL, defaulting to text.<br><br>

  For more advanced use, you may also pass in the path as the first argument

  and a object as the second argument, the signature follows the one specified

  in the Fetch API specification.

  This method is suitable for fetching files up to size of 64MB when "GET" is
  used.</p>
