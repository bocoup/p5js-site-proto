  <p>Sets the global texture wrapping mode. This controls how textures behave

  when their uv's go outside of the 0 to 1 range. There are three options:

  CLAMP, REPEAT, and MIRROR.</p>

  <p>CLAMP causes the pixels at the edge of the texture to extend to the bounds.

  REPEAT causes the texture to tile repeatedly until reaching the bounds.

  MIRROR works similarly to REPEAT but it flips the texture with every new
  tile.</p>

  <p>REPEAT & MIRROR are only available if the texture

  is a power of two size (128, 256, 512, 1024, etc.).</p>

  <p>This method will affect all textures in your sketch until a subsequent

  textureWrap() call is made.</p>

  <p>If only one argument is provided, it will be applied to both the

  horizontal and vertical axes.</p>
