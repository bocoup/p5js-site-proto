  <p>The <a href="#/p5/mousePressed">mousePressed()</a> function is called once
  after every time a mouse button

  is pressed. The mouseButton variable (see the related reference entry)

  can be used to determine which button has been pressed. If no

  <a href="#/p5/mousePressed">mousePressed()</a> function is defined, the <a
  href="#/p5/touchStarted">touchStarted()</a> function will be

  called instead if it is defined.<br><br>

  Browsers may have different default

  behaviors attached to various mouse events. To prevent any default

  behavior for this event, add "return false" to the end of the function.</p>
