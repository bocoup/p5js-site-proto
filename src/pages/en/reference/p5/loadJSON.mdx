  <p>Loads a JSON file from a file or a URL, and returns an Object.
  Note that even if the JSON file contains an Array, an Object will be
  returned with index numbers as keys.</p>
  <p>This method is asynchronous, meaning it may not finish before the next
  line in your sketch is executed. JSONP is supported via a polyfill and you
  can pass in as the second argument an object with definitions of the json
  callback following the syntax specified <a href="https://github.com/camsong/
  fetch-jsonp">here</a>.</p>
  <p>This method is suitable for fetching files up to size of 64MB.</p>
