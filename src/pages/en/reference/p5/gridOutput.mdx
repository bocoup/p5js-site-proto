  <p>Creates a screen reader-accessible description for shapes on the canvas.

  <code>gridOutput()</code> adds a general description, table of shapes, and
  list of

  shapes to the web page.</p>

  <p>The general description includes the canvas size, canvas color, and number
  of

  shapes. For example,

  <code>gray canvas, 100 by 100 pixels, contains 2 shapes:  1 circle 1
  square</code>.</p>

  <p><code>gridOutput()</code> uses its table of shapes as a grid. Each shape in
  the grid

  is placed in a cell whose row and column correspond to the shape's location

  on the canvas. The grid cells describe the color and type of shape at that

  location. For example, <code>red circle</code>. These descriptions can be
  selected

  individually to get more details. This is different from

  <a href="#/p5/textOutput">textOutput()</a>, which uses its table as a
  list.</p>

  <p>A list of shapes follows the table. The list describes the color, type,

  location, and area of each shape. For example,

  <code>red circle, location = middle, area = 3 %</code>.</p>

  <p>The <code>display</code> parameter is optional. It determines how the
  description is

  displayed. If <code>LABEL</code> is passed, as in
  <code>gridOutput(LABEL)</code>, the description

  will be visible in a div element next to the canvas. Using <code>LABEL</code>
  creates

  unhelpful duplicates for screen readers. Only use <code>LABEL</code> during

  development. If <code>FALLBACK</code> is passed, as in
  <code>gridOutput(FALLBACK)</code>, the

  description will only be visible to screen readers. This is the default

  mode.</p>
