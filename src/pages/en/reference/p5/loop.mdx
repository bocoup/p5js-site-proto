  <p>By default, p5.js loops through draw() continuously, executing the code
  within

  it. However, the <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> loop may be stopped by calling

  <a href="#/p5/noLoop">noLoop()</a>. In that case, the <a
  href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>

  loop can be resumed with loop().</p>

  <p>Avoid calling loop() from inside setup().</p>

  <p>Use <a href="#/p5/isLooping">isLooping()</a> to check the current state of
  <a href="#/p5/loop">loop()</a>.</p>
