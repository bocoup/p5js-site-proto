  <p>The system variable key always contains the value of the most recent

  key on the keyboard that was typed. To get the proper capitalization, it

  is best to use it within <a href="#/p5/keyTyped">keyTyped()</a>. For non-ASCII
  keys, use the <a href="#/p5/keyCode">keyCode</a>

  variable.</p>
