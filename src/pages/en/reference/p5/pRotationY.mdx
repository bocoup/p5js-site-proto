  <p>The system variable pRotationY always contains the rotation of the
  device along the y axis in the frame previous to the current frame.
  If the sketch <a href="#/p5/angleMode"> angleMode()</a> is set to DEGREES,
  the value will be -90 to 90. If it is set to RADIANS, the value will
  be -PI/2 to PI/2.</p>
  <p>pRotationY can also be used with rotationY to determine the rotate
  direction of the device along the Y-axis.</p>
