  <p>Calculates a number between two numbers at a specific increment. The
  <code>amt</code>

  parameter is the amount to interpolate between the two numbers. 0.0 is

  equal to the first number, 0.1 is very near the first number, 0.5 is

  half-way in between, and 1.0 is equal to the second number. The
  <code>lerp()</code>

  function is convenient for creating motion along a straight path and for

  drawing dotted lines.</p>

  <p>If the value of <code>amt</code> is less than 0 or more than 1,
  <code>lerp()</code> will return a

  number outside of the original interval. For example, calling

  <code>lerp(0, 10, 1.5)</code> will return 15.</p>
