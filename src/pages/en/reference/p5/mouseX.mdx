  <p>The system variable mouseX always contains the current horizontal
  position of the mouse, relative to (0, 0) of the canvas. The value at
  the top-left corner is (0, 0) for 2-D and (-width/2, -height/2) for WebGL.
  If touch is used instead of mouse input, mouseX will hold the x value
  of the most recent touch point.</p>
