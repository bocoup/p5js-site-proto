  <p>The <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a> function is called once when the
  program starts. It's used to

  define initial environment properties such as screen size and background

  color and to load media such as images and fonts as the program starts.

  There can only be one <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a> function for each
  program and it shouldn't

  be called again after its initial execution.</p>

  <p>Note: Variables declared within <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a> are not
  accessible within other

  functions, including <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>.</p>
