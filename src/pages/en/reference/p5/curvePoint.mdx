  <p>Evaluates the curve at position t for points a, b, c, d.
  The parameter t varies between 0 and 1, a and d are control points
  of the curve, and b and c are the start and end points of the curve.
  This can be done once with the x coordinates and a second time
  with the y coordinates to get the location of a curve at t.</p>
