  <p>Squares a number, which means multiplying the number by itself. The value

  returned is always a positive number.</p>

  <p>For example, <code>sq(3)</code> evaluates 3 × 3  which is 9.
  <code>sq(-3)</code> evaluates

  -3 × -3 which is also 9.  Multiplying two negative numbers produces

  a positive number.</p>
