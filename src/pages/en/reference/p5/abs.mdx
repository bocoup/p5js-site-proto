  <p>Calculates the absolute value of a number. A number's absolute value is its

  distance from zero on the number line. -5 and 5 are both five units away

  from zero, so calling <code>abs(-5)</code> and <code>abs(5)</code> both return
  5. The absolute

  value of a number is always positive.</p>
