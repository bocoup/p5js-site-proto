  <p>Starts creating a new p5.Geometry. Subsequent shapes drawn will be added

  to the geometry and then returned when

  <a href="#/p5/endGeometry">endGeometry()</a> is called. One can also use

  <a href="#/p5/buildGeometry">buildGeometry()</a> to pass a function that

  draws shapes.</p>

  <p>If you need to draw complex shapes every frame which don't change over
  time,

  combining them upfront with <code>beginGeometry()</code> and
  <code>endGeometry()</code> and then

  drawing that will run faster than repeatedly drawing the individual
  pieces.</p>
