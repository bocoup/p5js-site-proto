  <p>Calculates the distance between two points.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>dist()</code> with four parameters calculates distance
  in two

  dimensions.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>dist()</code> with six parameters calculates distance
  in three

  dimensions.</p>

  <p>Use <a href="#/p5.Vector/dist">p5.Vector.dist()</a> to calculate the

  distance between two <a href="#/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> objects.</p>
