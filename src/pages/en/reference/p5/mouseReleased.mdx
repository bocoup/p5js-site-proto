  <p>The <a href="#/p5/mouseReleased">mouseReleased()</a> function is called
  every time a mouse button is

  released. If no <a href="#/p5/mouseReleased">mouseReleased()</a> function is
  defined, the <a href="#/p5/touchEnded">touchEnded()</a>

  function will be called instead if it is defined.<br><br>

  Browsers may have different default

  behaviors attached to various mouse events. To prevent any default

  behavior for this event, add "return false" to the end of the function.</p>
