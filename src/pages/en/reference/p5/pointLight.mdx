  <p>Creates a point light with the given color and position.</p>
  <p>A point light emits light from a single point in all directions.
  Because the light is emitted from a specific point (position),
  it has a different effect when it is positioned farther vs. nearer
  an object.</p>
  <p>A maximum of <strong>5</strong> point lights can be active at once.</p>
  <p>Note: lights need to be called (whether directly or indirectly)
  within draw() to remain persistent in a looping program.
  Placing them in setup() will cause them to only have an effect
  the first time through the loop.</p>
