  <p>Creates and names a new constant. Like a variable created with <a
  href="#/p5/let">let</a>,

  a constant that is created with <a href="#/p5/const">const</a> is a container
  for a value,

  however constants cannot be reassigned once they are declared. Although it is

  noteworthy that for non-primitive data types like objects & arrays, their

  elements can still be changeable. So if a variable is assigned an array, you

  can still add or remove elements from the array but cannot reassign another

  array to it. Also unlike <code>let</code>, you cannot declare variables
  without value

  using const.</p>

  <p>Constants have block-scope. This means that the constant only exists within

  the <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block">

  block</a> that it is created within. A constant cannot be redeclared within a
  scope in which it

  already exists.</p>

  <p>From <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const">the
  MDN entry</a>:

  Declares a read-only named constant.

  Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the 'let'
  statement.

  The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be
  redeclared.</p>

    <div class='norender'>
    <code>
    // define myFavNumber as a constant and give it the value 7
    const myFavNumber = 7;
    console.log('my favorite number is: ' + myFavNumber);
    </code>
    </div>

    <div class='norender'>
    <code>
    const bigCats = ['lion', 'tiger', 'panther'];
    bigCats.push('leopard');
    console.log(bigCats);
    // bigCats = ['cat']; // throws error as re-assigning not allowed for const
    </code>
    </div>

    <div class='norender'>
    <code>
    const wordFrequency = {};
    wordFrequency['hello'] = 2;
    wordFrequency['bye'] = 1;
    console.log(wordFrequency);
    // wordFrequency = { 'a': 2, 'b': 3}; // throws error here
