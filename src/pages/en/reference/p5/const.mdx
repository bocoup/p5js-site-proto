  <p>Creates and names a new constant. Like a variable created with <a
  href="#/p5/let">let</a>,

  a constant that is created with <a href="#/p5/const">const</a> is a container
  for a value,

  however constants cannot be reassigned once they are declared. Although it is

  noteworthy that for non-primitive data types like objects & arrays, their

  elements can still be changeable. So if a variable is assigned an array, you

  can still add or remove elements from the array but cannot reassign another

  array to it. Also unlike <code>let</code>, you cannot declare variables
  without value

  using const.</p>

  <p>Constants have block-scope. This means that the constant only exists within

  the <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block">

  block</a> that it is created within. A constant cannot be redeclared within a
  scope in which it

  already exists.</p>

  <p>From <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const">the
  MDN entry</a>:

  Declares a read-only named constant.

  Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the 'let'
  statement.

  The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be
  redeclared.</p>
