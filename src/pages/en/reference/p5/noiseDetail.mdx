  <p>Adjusts the character of the noise produced by the

  <a href="#/p5/noise">noise()</a> function.</p>

  <p>Perlin noise values are created by adding layers of noise together. The

  noise layers, called octaves, are similar to harmonics in music. Lower

  octaves contribute more to the output signal. They define the overall

  intensity of the noise. Higher octaves create finer-grained details.</p>

  <p>By default, noise values are created by combining four octaves. Each higher

  octave contributes half as much (50% less) compared to its predecessor.

  <code>noiseDetail()</code> changes the number of octaves and the falloff
  amount. For

  example, calling <code>noiseDetail(6, 0.25)</code> ensures that

  <a href="#/p5/noise">noise()</a> will use six octaves. Each higher octave

  will contribute 25% as much (75% less) compared to its predecessor. Falloff

  values between 0 and 1 are valid. However, falloff values greater than 0.5

  might result in noise values greater than 1.</p>
