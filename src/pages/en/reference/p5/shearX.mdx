description: >
  <p>Shears a shape around the x-axis by the amount specified by the angle

  parameter. Angles should be specified in the current angleMode.

  Objects are always sheared around their relative position to the origin

  and positive numbers shear objects in a clockwise direction.</p>

  <p>Transformations apply to everything that happens after and subsequent

  calls to the function accumulates the effect. For example, calling

  shearX(PI/2) and then shearX(PI/2) is the same as shearX(PI).

  If <a href="#/p5/shearX">shearX()</a> is called within the <a
  href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>,

  the transformation is reset when the loop begins again.</p>

  <p>Technically, <a href="#/p5/shearX">shearX()</a> multiplies the current

  transformation matrix by a rotation matrix. This function can be further

  controlled by the <a href="#/p5/push">push()</a> and <a
  href="#/p5/pop">pop()</a> functions.</p>
