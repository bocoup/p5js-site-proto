  This function checks if the file is in ASCII format or in Binary formatIt is
  done by searching keyword `solid` at the start of the file.An ASCII STL data
  must begin with `solid` as the first six bytes.

  However, ASCII STLs lacking the SPACE after the `d` are known to be

  plentiful. So, check the first 5 bytes for `solid`.Several encodings, such as
  UTF-8, precede the text with up to 5 bytes:

  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#Byte_order_marks_by_encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#Byte_order_marks_by_encoding)

  Search for `solid` to start anywhere after those prefixes.
