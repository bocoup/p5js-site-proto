  <p>The <a href="#/p5/endShape">endShape()</a> function is the companion to <a
  href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a> and may only be

  called after <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a>. When <a
  href="#/p5/endshape">endShape()</a> is called, all of the image

  data defined since the previous call to <a
  href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a> is written into the image

  buffer. The constant CLOSE is the value for the <code>mode</code> parameter to
  close

  the shape (to connect the beginning and the end).

  When using instancing with <a href="#/p5/endShape">endShape()</a> the
  instancing will not apply to the strokes.

  When the count parameter is used with a value greater than 1, it enables
  instancing for shapes built when in WEBGL mode. Instancing

  is a feature that allows the GPU to efficiently draw multiples of the same
  shape. It's often used for particle effects or other

  times when you need a lot of repetition. In order to take advantage of
  instancing, you will also need to write your own custom

  shader using the gl_InstanceID keyword. You can read more about instancing

  or by working from the example on this
