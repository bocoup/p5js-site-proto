  <p>Using the <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a> and <a
  href="#/p5/endShape">endShape()</a> functions allow creating more

  complex forms. <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a> begins recording
  vertices for a shape and

  <a href="#/p5/endShape">endShape()</a> stops recording. The value of the kind
  parameter tells it which

  types of shapes to create from the provided vertices. With no mode

  specified, the shape can be any irregular polygon.</p>

  <p>The parameters available for <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a>
  are:</p>

  <p>POINTS

  Draw a series of points</p>

  <p>LINES

  Draw a series of unconnected line segments (individual lines)</p>

  <p>TRIANGLES

  Draw a series of separate triangles</p>

  <p>TRIANGLE_FAN

  Draw a series of connected triangles sharing the first vertex in a fan-like
  fashion</p>

  <p>TRIANGLE_STRIP

  Draw a series of connected triangles in strip fashion</p>

  <p>QUADS

  Draw a series of separate quads</p>

  <p>QUAD_STRIP

  Draw quad strip using adjacent edges to form the next quad</p>

  <p>TESS (WEBGL only)

  Handle irregular polygon for filling curve by explicit tessellation</p>

  <p>After calling the <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a> function, a
  series of <a href="#/p5/vertex">vertex()</a> commands must follow. To stop

  drawing the shape, call <a href="#/p5/endShape">endShape()</a>. Each shape
  will be outlined with the

  current stroke color and filled with the fill color.</p>

  <p>Transformations such as <a href="#/p5/translate">translate()</a>, <a
  href="#/p5/rotate">rotate()</a>, and <a href="#/p5/scale">scale()</a> do not
  work

  within <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a>. It is also not possible to
  use other shapes, such as

  <a href="#/p5/ellipse">ellipse()</a> or <a href="#/p5/rect">rect()</a> within
  <a href="#/p5/beginShape">beginShape()</a>.</p>
