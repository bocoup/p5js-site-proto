  <p>Draws a cubic Bezier curve on the screen. These curves are defined by a
  series of anchor and control points. The first two parameters specify
  the first anchor point and the last two parameters specify the other
  anchor point, which become the first and last points on the curve. The
  middle parameters specify the two control points which define the shape
  of the curve. Approximately speaking, control points "pull" the curve
  towards them.</p>
  <p>Bezier curves were developed by French automotive engineer Pierre Bezier,
  and are commonly used in computer graphics to define gently sloping curves.
