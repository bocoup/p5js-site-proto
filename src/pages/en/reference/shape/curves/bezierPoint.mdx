descriptionText: |-
  Given the x or y co-ordinate values of control and anchor points of a bezier
  curve, it evaluates the x or y coordinate of the bezier at position t. The
  parameters a and d are the x or y coordinates of first and last points on the
  curve while b and c are of the control points.The final parameter t is the
  position of the resultant point which is given between 0 and 1.
  This can be done once with the x coordinates and a second time
  with the y coordinates to get the location of a bezier curve at t.
params:
  - name: a
    description: coordinate of first point on the curve

  - name: b
    description: coordinate of first control point

  - name: c
    description: coordinate of second control point

  - name: d
    description: coordinate of second point on the curve
    type: Number
  - name: t
