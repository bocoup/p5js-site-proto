  <p>Modifies the quality of forms created with <a href="#/p5/curve">curve()</a>

  and <a href="#/p5/curveVertex">curveVertex()</a>.The parameter tightness

  determines how the curve fits to the vertex points. The value 0.0 is the

  default value for tightness (this value defines the curves to be Catmull-Rom

  splines) and the value 1.0 connects all the points with straight lines.

  Values within the range -5.0 and 5.0 will deform the curves but will leave

  them recognizable and as values increase in magnitude, they will continue to
  deform.</p>
