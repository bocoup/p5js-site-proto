descriptionText: |-
  Evaluates the tangent to the curve at position t for points a, b, c, d.
  The parameter t varies between 0 and 1, a and d are points on the curve,
  and b and c are the control points.
params:
  - name: a
    description: coordinate of first control point

  - name: c
    description: coordinate of second point on the curve
    type: Number
  - name: d
