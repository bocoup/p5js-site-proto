  <p>Draws a curved line on the screen between two points, given as the

  middle four parameters. The first two parameters are a control point, as

  if the curve came from this point even though it's not drawn. The last

  two parameters similarly describe the other control point. <br /><br />

  Longer curves can be created by putting a series of <a
  href="#/p5/curve">curve()</a> functions

  together or using <a href="#/p5/curveVertex">curveVertex()</a>. An additional
  function called

  <a href="#/p5/curveTightness">curveTightness()</a> provides control for the
  visual quality of the curve.

  The <a href="#/p5/curve">curve()</a> function is an implementation of
  Catmull-Rom splines.</p>
