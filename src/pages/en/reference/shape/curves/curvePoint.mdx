descriptionText: |-
  Evaluates the curve at position t for points a, b, c, d.
  The parameter t varies between 0 and 1, a and d are control points
  of the curve, and b and c are the start and end points of the curve.
  This can be done once with the x coordinates and a second time
  with the y coordinates to get the location of a curve at t.
params:
  - name: a
    description: coordinate of first control point of the curve
    type: Number
  - name: b
    description: coordinate of first point
    type: Number
  - name: c
    description: coordinate of second point
    type: Number
  - name: d
    description: coordinate of second control point
    type: Number
  - name: t
    description: value between 0 and 1
