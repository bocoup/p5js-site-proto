  <p>Creates a new <a href="#/p5.Geometry">p5.Geometry</a> that contains all

  the shapes drawn in a provided callback function. The returned combined shape

  can then be drawn all at once using <a href="#/p5/model">model()</a>.</p>

  <p>If you need to draw complex shapes every frame which don't change over
  time,

  combining them with <code>buildGeometry()</code> once and then drawing that
  will run

  faster than repeatedly drawing the individual pieces.</p>

  <p>One can also draw shapes directly between

  <a href="#/p5/beginGeometry">beginGeometry()</a> and

  <a href="#/p5/endGeometry">endGeometry()</a> instead of using a callback

  function.</p>
