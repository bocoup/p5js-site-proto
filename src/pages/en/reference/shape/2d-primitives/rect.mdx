  <p>Draws a rectangle to the canvas. A rectangle is a four-sided polygon with

  every angle at ninety degrees. By default, the first two parameters set the

  location of the rectangle's upper-left corner. The third and fourth set the

  shape's the width and height, respectively. The way these parameters are

  interpreted may be changed with the <a href="#/p5/rectMode">rectMode()</a>

  function.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>rect()</code> with five parameters creates a rounded
  rectangle. The

  fifth parameter is used as the radius value for all four corners.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>rect()</code> with eight parameters also creates a
  rounded rectangle.

  When using eight parameters, the latter four set the radius of the arc at

  each corner separately. The radii start with the top-left corner and move

  clockwise around the rectangle. If any of these parameters are omitted, they

  are set to the value of the last specified corner radius.</p>
