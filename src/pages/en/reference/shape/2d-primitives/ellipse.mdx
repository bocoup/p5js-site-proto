  <p>Draws an ellipse (oval) to the canvas. An ellipse with equal width and
  height

  is a circle. By default, the first two parameters set the location of the

  center of the ellipse. The third and fourth parameters set the shape's width

  and height, respectively. The origin may be changed with the

  <a href="#/p5/ellipseMode">ellipseMode()</a> function.</p>

  <p>If no height is specified, the value of width is used for both the width
  and

  height. If a negative height or width is specified, the absolute value is

  taken.</p>
