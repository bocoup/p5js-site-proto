  Sets the style for rendering line endings. These ends are either rounded

  (`ROUND`), squared (`SQUARE`), or extended (`PROJECT`). The default cap is

  `ROUND`.The argument passed to `strokeCap()` must be written in ALL CAPS
  because

  the constants `ROUND`, `SQUARE`, and `PROJECT` are defined this way.

  JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.
params:
  - name: cap
    description: 'either ROUND, SQUARE, or PROJECT'

    <div>

    <code>

    strokeWeight(12.0);

    strokeCap(ROUND);

    line(20, 30, 80, 30);

    strokeCap(SQUARE);

    line(20, 50, 80, 50);

    strokeCap(PROJECT);

    line(20, 70, 80, 70);

    describe('Three horizontal lines. The top line has rounded ends, the middle
    line has squared ends, and the bottom line has longer, squared ends.');

    </code>
