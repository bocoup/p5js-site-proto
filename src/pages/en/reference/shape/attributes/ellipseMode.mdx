  Modifies the location from which ellipses, circles, and arcs are drawn. By
  default, the

  first two parameters are the x- and y-coordinates of the shape's center. The
  next

  parameters are its width and height. This is equivalent to calling
  `ellipseMode(CENTER)`.`ellipseMode(RADIUS)` also uses the first two parameters
  to set the x- and y-coordinates

  of the shape's center. The next parameters are half of the shapes's width and
  height.

  Calling `ellipse(0, 0, 10, 15)` draws a shape with a width of 20 and height of
  30.`ellipseMode(CORNER)` uses the first two parameters as the upper-left
  corner of the

  shape. The next parameters are its width and height.`ellipseMode(CORNERS)`
  uses the first two parameters as the location of one corner

  of the ellipse's bounding box. The third and fourth parameters are the
  location of the

  opposite corner.The argument passed to `ellipseMode()` must be written in ALL
  CAPS because the constants

  `CENTER`, `RADIUS`, `CORNER`, and `CORNERS` are defined this way. JavaScript
  is a

  case-sensitive language.
