  <p>Modifies the location from which rectangles and squares are drawn. By
  default,

  the first two parameters are the x- and y-coordinates of the shape's
  upper-left

  corner. The next parameters are its width and height. This is equivalent to

  calling <code>rectMode(CORNER)</code>.</p>

  <p><code>rectMode(CORNERS)</code> also uses the first two parameters as the
  location of one of

  the corners. The third and fourth parameters are the location of the opposite

  corner.</p>

  <p><code>rectMode(CENTER)</code> uses the first two parameters as the x- and
  y-coordinates of

  the shape's center. The next parameters are its width and height.</p>

  <p><code>rectMode(RADIUS)</code> also uses the first two parameters as the x-
  and y-coordinates

  of the shape's center. The next parameters are half of the shape's width and

  height.</p>

  <p>The argument passed to <code>rectMode()</code> must be written in ALL CAPS
  because the

  constants <code>CENTER</code>, <code>RADIUS</code>, <code>CORNER</code>, and
  <code>CORNERS</code> are defined this way.

  JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.</p>
