  Modifies the location from which rectangles and squares are drawn. By default,

  the first two parameters are the x- and y-coordinates of the shape's
  upper-left

  corner. The next parameters are its width and height. This is equivalent to

  calling `rectMode(CORNER)`.`rectMode(CORNERS)` also uses the first two
  parameters as the location of one of

  the corners. The third and fourth parameters are the location of the opposite

  corner.`rectMode(CENTER)` uses the first two parameters as the x- and
  y-coordinates of

  the shape's center. The next parameters are its width and
  height.`rectMode(RADIUS)` also uses the first two parameters as the x- and
  y-coordinates

  of the shape's center. The next parameters are half of the shape's width and

  height.The argument passed to `rectMode()` must be written in ALL CAPS because
  the

  constants `CENTER`, `RADIUS`, `CORNER`, and `CORNERS` are defined this way.

  JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.
