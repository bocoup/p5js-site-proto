descriptionText: >
  <p>Loads an image to create a <a href="#/p5.Image">p5.Image</a> object.</p>

  <p><code>loadImage()</code> interprets the first parameter one of three ways.
  If the path

  to an image file is provided, <code>loadImage()</code> will load it. Paths to
  local

  files should be relative, such as <code>'assets/thundercat.jpg'</code>. URLs
  such as

  <code>'https://example.com/thundercat.jpg'</code> may be blocked due to
  browser

  security. Raw image data can also be passed as a base64 encoded image in

  the form <code>'data:image/png;base64,arandomsequenceofcharacters'</code>.</p>

  <p>The second parameter is optional. If a function is passed, it will be

  called once the image has loaded. The callback function can optionally use

  the new <a href="#/p5.Image">p5.Image</a> object.</p>

  <p>The third parameter is also optional. If a function is passed, it will be

  called if the image fails to load. The callback function can optionally use

  the event error.</p>

  <p>Images can take time to load. Calling <code>loadImage()</code> in

  <a href="#/p5/preload">preload()</a> ensures images load before they're

  used in <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a> or <a
  href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a>.</p>
