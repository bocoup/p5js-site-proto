  <p>Captures a sequence of frames from the canvas that can be used to create a

  movie. Frames are downloaded as individual image files by default.</p>

  <p>The first parameter, <code>filename</code>, sets the prefix for the file
  names. For

  example, setting the prefix to <code>'frame'</code> would generate the image
  files

  <code>frame0.png</code>, <code>frame1.png</code>, and so on. The second
  parameter, <code>extension</code>,

  sets the file type to either <code>'png'</code> or <code>'jpg'</code>.</p>

  <p>The third parameter, <code>duration</code>, sets the duration to record in
  seconds.

  The maximum duration is 15 seconds. The fourth parameter,
  <code>framerate</code>, sets

  the number of frames to record per second. The maximum frame rate value is

  22. Limits are placed on <code>duration</code> and <code>framerate</code> to
  avoid using too much

  memory. Recording large canvases can easily crash sketches or even web

  browsers.</p>

  <p>The fifth parameter, <code>callback</code>, is optional. If a function is
  passed,

  image files won't be saved by default. The callback function can be used

  to process an array containing the data for each captured frame. The array

  of image data contains a sequence of objects with three properties for each

  frame: <code>imageData</code>, <code>filename</code>, and
  <code>extension</code>.</p>

      <p>callback function that will be executed

                                       should accept an array as argument. The
                                       array will contain the specified number of
                                       frames of objects. Each object has three
                                       properties: <code>imageData</code>, <code>filename</code>, and <code>extension</code>.</p>
