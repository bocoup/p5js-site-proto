descriptionText: >-
  Reads the contents of a file and creates a String array of its individual

  lines. If the name of the file is used as the parameter, as in the above

  example, the file must be located in the sketch
  directory/folder.Alternatively, the file may be loaded from anywhere on the
  local

  computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and

  Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a

  URL for a file found on a network.This method is asynchronous, meaning it may
  not finish before the next

  line in your sketch is executed.This method is suitable for fetching files up
  to size of 64MB.
params:
  - name: filename
    description: name of the file or url to load
    type: String
  - name: callback
    description: |-
      function to be executed after <a href="#/p5/loadStrings">loadStrings()</a>
      completes, Array is passed in as first
      argument
    type: function
  - name: errorCallback
    description: |-
      function to be executed if
      there is an error, response is passed
      in as first argument
    type: function
kind: function
name: loadStrings
namespace: loadStrings
examples:
  - >-
    Calling loadStrings() inside <a href="#/p5/preload">preload()</a> guarantees
    to complete the

    operation before <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a> and <a
    href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> are called.


    <div><code>

    let result;

    function preload() {
      result = loadStrings('assets/test.txt');
    }


    function setup() {
      background(200);
      text(random(result), 10, 10, 80, 80);
      describe(`randomly generated text from a file,
        for example "i smell like butter"`);
    }

    </code></div>


    Outside of preload(), you may supply a callback function to handle the

    object:


    <div><code>

    function setup() {
      loadStrings('assets/test.txt', pickString);
      describe(`randomly generated text from a file,
        for example "i have three feet"`);
    }


    function pickString(result) {
      background(200);
      text(random(result), 10, 10, 80, 80);
    }

    </code></div>
