  <p>Reads the contents of a file and creates an XML object with its values.

  If the name of the file is used as the parameter, as in the above example,

  the file must be located in the sketch directory/folder.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local

  computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and

  Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a

  URL for a file found on a network.</p>

  <p>This method is asynchronous, meaning it may not finish before the next

  line in your sketch is executed. Calling <a href="#/p5/loadXML">loadXML()</a>
  inside <a href="#/p5/preload">preload()</a>

  guarantees to complete the operation before <a href="#/p5/setup">setup()</a>
  and <a href="#/p5/draw">draw()</a> are called.</p>

  <p>Outside of <a href="#/p5/preload">preload()</a>, you may supply a callback
  function to handle the

  object.</p>

  <p>This method is suitable for fetching files up to size of 64MB.</p>
