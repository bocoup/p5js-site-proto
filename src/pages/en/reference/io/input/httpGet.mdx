  <p>Method for executing an HTTP GET request. If data type is not specified,

  p5 will try to guess based on the URL, defaulting to text. This is equivalent

  calling <code>httpDo(path, 'GET')</code>. The 'binary' datatype will return

  a Blob object, and the 'arrayBuffer' datatype will return an ArrayBuffer

  which can be used to initialize typed arrays (such as Uint8Array).</p>
