descriptionText: |-
  Thin wrapper around a renderer, to be used for creating a
  graphics buffer object. Use this class if you need
  to draw into an off-screen graphics buffer. The two parameters define the
  width and height in pixels. The fields and methods for this class are
  extensive, but mirror the normal drawing API for p5.
