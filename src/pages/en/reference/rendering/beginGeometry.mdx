  Starts creating a new p5.Geometry. Subsequent shapes drawn will be added

  to the geometry and then returned when

  <a href="#/p5/endGeometry">endGeometry()</a> is called. One can also use

  <a href="#/p5/buildGeometry">buildGeometry()</a> to pass a function that

  draws shapes.If you need to draw complex shapes every frame which don't change
  over time,

  combining them upfront with `beginGeometry()` and `endGeometry()` and then

  drawing that will run faster than repeatedly drawing the individual pieces.
