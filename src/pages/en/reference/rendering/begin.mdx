  <p>Begin drawing to this framebuffer. Subsequent drawing functions to the
  canvas the framebuffer is attached to will not be immediately visible, and
  will instead be drawn to the framebuffer's texture. Call
  <a href="#/p5.Framebuffer/end">end()</a> when finished to make draw
  functions go right to the canvas again and to be able to read the
