  <p>Maps a number from one range to a value between 0 and 1.</p>

  <p>For example, <code>norm(2, 0, 10)</code> returns 0.2. 2's position in the
  original

  range [0, 10] is proportional to 0.2's position in the range [0, 1]. This

  is equivalent to calling <code>map(2, 0, 10, 0, 1)</code>.</p>

  <p>Numbers outside of the original range are not constrained between 0 and 1.

  Out-of-range values are often intentional and useful.</p>
