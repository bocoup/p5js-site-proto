module: Math
submodule: Calculation
descriptionText: >-
  Maps a number from one range to a value between 0 and 1.For example, `norm(2,
  0, 10)` returns 0.2. 2's position in the original

  range [0, 10] is proportional to 0.2's position in the range [0, 1]. This

  is equivalent to calling `map(2, 0, 10, 0, 1)`.Numbers outside of the original
  range are not constrained between 0 and 1.

  Out-of-range values are often intentional and useful.
