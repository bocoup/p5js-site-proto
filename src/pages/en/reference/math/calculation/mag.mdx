  <p>Calculates the magnitude, or length, of a vector. A vector is like an arrow

  pointing in space. Vectors are commonly used for programming motion.</p>

  <p>Vectors don't have a "start" position because the same arrow can be drawn

  anywhere. A vector's magnitude can be thought of as the distance from the

  origin (0, 0) to its tip at (x, y). <code>mag(x, y)</code> is a shortcut for
  calling

  <code>dist(0, 0, x, y)</code>.</p>
