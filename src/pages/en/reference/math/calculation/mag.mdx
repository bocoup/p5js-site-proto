descriptionText: >-
  Calculates the magnitude, or length, of a vector. A vector is like an arrow

  pointing in space. Vectors are commonly used for programming motion.Vectors
  don't have a "start" position because the same arrow can be drawn

  anywhere. A vector's magnitude can be thought of as the distance from the

  origin (0, 0) to its tip at (x, y). `mag(x, y)` is a shortcut for calling

  `dist(0, 0, x, y)`.

    describe('A diagonal line is drawn from the top left of the canvas. The
    number 50 is written at the end of the line.');
