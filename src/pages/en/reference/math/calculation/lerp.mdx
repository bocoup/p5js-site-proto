descriptionText: >-
  Calculates a number between two numbers at a specific increment. The `amt`

  parameter is the amount to interpolate between the two numbers. 0.0 is

  equal to the first number, 0.1 is very near the first number, 0.5 is

  half-way in between, and 1.0 is equal to the second number. The `lerp()`

  function is convenient for creating motion along a straight path and for

  drawing dotted lines.If the value of `amt` is less than 0 or more than 1,
  `lerp()` will return a

  number outside of the original interval. For example, calling

  `lerp(0, 10, 1.5)` will return 15.
