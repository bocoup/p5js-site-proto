descriptionText: >-
  Returns a random number fitting a Gaussian, or normal, distribution. Normal

  distributions look like bell curves when plotted. Values from a normal

  distribution cluster around a central value called the mean. The cluster's

  standard deviation describes its spread.By default, `randomGaussian()`
  produces different results each time a

  sketch runs. The <a href="#/p5/randomSeed">randomSeed()</a> function can be

  used to generate the same sequence of numbers each time a sketch runs.There's
  no minimum or maximum value that `randomGaussian()` might return.

  Values far from the mean are very unlikely and values near the mean are

  very likely.The version of `randomGaussian()` with no parameters returns
  values with a

  mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.The version of `randomGaussian()` with
  one parameter interprets the

  argument passed as the mean. The standard deviation is 1.The version of
  `randomGaussian()` with two parameters interprets the first

  argument passed as the mean and the second as the standard deviation.
