descriptionText: >
  <p>Returns a random number fitting a Gaussian, or normal, distribution. Normal

  distributions look like bell curves when plotted. Values from a normal

  distribution cluster around a central value called the mean. The cluster's

  standard deviation describes its spread.</p>

  <p>By default, <code>randomGaussian()</code> produces different results each
  time a

  sketch runs. The <a href="#/p5/randomSeed">randomSeed()</a> function can be

  used to generate the same sequence of numbers each time a sketch runs.</p>

  <p>There's no minimum or maximum value that <code>randomGaussian()</code>
  might return.

  Values far from the mean are very unlikely and values near the mean are

  very likely.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>randomGaussian()</code> with no parameters returns
  values with a

  mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>randomGaussian()</code> with one parameter interprets
  the

  argument passed as the mean. The standard deviation is 1.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>randomGaussian()</code> with two parameters interprets
  the first

  argument passed as the mean and the second as the standard deviation.</p>
