descriptionText: >-
  A class to describe a two or three-dimensional vector. A vector is like an

  arrow pointing in space. Vectors have both magnitude (length) and

  direction.`p5.Vector` objects are often used to program motion because they
  simplify

  the math. For example, a moving ball has a position and a velocity.

  Position describes where the ball is in space. The ball's position vector

  extends from the origin to the ball's center. Velocity describes the ball's

  speed and the direction it's moving. If the ball is moving straight up, its

  velocity vector points straight up. Adding the ball's velocity vector to

  its position vector moves it, as in `pos.add(vel)`. Vector math relies on

  methods inside the `p5.Vector` class.
params:
  - name: x
    description: x component of the vector.

  - name: 'y'
    description: y component of the vector.
    type: Number
  - name: z
    description: z component of the vector.

    at the bottom right.');
