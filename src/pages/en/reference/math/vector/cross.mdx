  <p>Returns the cross product of two vectors. The cross product is a vector

  that points straight out of the plane created by two vectors. The cross

  product's magnitude is the area of the parallelogram formed by the original

  two vectors.</p>

  <p>The static version of <code>cross()</code>, as in <code>p5.Vector.cross(v1,

  as calling <code>v1.cross(v2)</code>.</p>
