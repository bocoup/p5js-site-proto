  <p>Returns random numbers that can be tuned to feel more organic. The values

  returned will always be between 0 and 1.</p>

  <p>Values returned by <a href="#/p5/random">random()</a> and

  <a href="#/p5/randomGaussian">randomGaussian()</a> can change by large

  amounts between function calls. By contrast, values returned by
  <code>noise()</code>

  can be made "smooth". Calls to <code>noise()</code> with similar inputs will
  produce

  similar outputs. <code>noise()</code> is used to create textures, motion,
  shapes,

  terrains, and so on. Ken Perlin invented <code>noise()</code> while animating
  the

  original <em>Tron</em> film in the 1980s.</p>

  <p><code>noise()</code> returns the same value for a given input while a
  sketch is

  running. It produces different results each time a sketch runs. The

  <a href="#/p5/noiseSeed">noiseSeed()</a> function can be used to generate

  the same sequence of Perlin noise values each time a sketch runs.</p>

  <p>The character of the noise can be adjusted in two ways. The first way is to

  scale the inputs. <code>noise()</code> interprets inputs as coordinates. The
  sequence

  of noise values will be smoother when the input coordinates are closer. The

  second way is to use the <a href="#/p5/noiseDetail">noiseDetail()</a>

  function.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>noise()</code> with one parameter computes noise
  values in one

  dimension. This dimension can be thought of as space, as in
  <code>noise(x)</code>, or

  time, as in <code>noise(t)</code>.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>noise()</code> with two parameters computes noise
  values in two

  dimensions. These dimensions can be thought of as space, as in

  <code>noise(x, y)</code>, or space and time, as in <code>noise(x,
  t)</code>.</p>

  <p>The version of <code>noise()</code> with three parameters computes noise
  values in

  three dimensions. These dimensions can be thought of as space, as in

  <code>noise(x, y, z)</code>, or space and time, as in <code>noise(x, y,
  t)</code>.</p>
