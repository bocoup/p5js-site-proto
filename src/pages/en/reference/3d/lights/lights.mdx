  <p>Places an ambient and directional light in the scene.
  The lights are set to ambientLight(128, 128, 128) and
  directionalLight(128, 128, 128, 0, 0, -1).</p>
  <p>Note: lights need to be called (whether directly or indirectly)
  within draw() to remain persistent in a looping program.
  Placing them in setup() will cause them to only have an effect
  the first time through the loop.</p>
