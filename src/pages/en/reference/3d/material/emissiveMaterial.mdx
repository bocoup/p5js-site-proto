  <p>An emissive material will display the emissive color at
  full strength regardless of lighting. This can give the
  appearance that the object is glowing.</p>
  <p>Note, "emissive" is a misnomer in the sense that the material
  does not actually emit light that will affect surrounding objects.</p>
