  <p>Sets the coordinate space for texture mapping. The default mode is IMAGE

  which refers to the actual coordinates of the image.

  NORMAL refers to a normalized space of values ranging from 0 to 1.</p>

  <p>With IMAGE, if an image is 100×200 pixels, mapping the image onto the
  entire

  size of a quad would require the points (0,0) (100, 0) (100,200) (0,200).

  The same mapping in NORMAL is (0,0) (1,0) (1,1) (0,1).</p>
