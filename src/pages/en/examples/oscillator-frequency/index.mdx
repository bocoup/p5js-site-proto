title: Oscillator Frequency
arialabel: >-
  The wavelength travels across the screen and as the userâ€™s mouse moves left,
  the wavelength is longer and the frequency is slower and both increase as the
  mouse moves right
description: >-
  <p>Control an Oscillator and view the waveform using FFT.

  MouseX is mapped to frequency, mouseY is mapped to amplitude.</p>
