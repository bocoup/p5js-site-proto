title: Conditional Shapes
arialabel: >-
  The middle of the window is white and the user’s mouse draws red dots within
  it. The side edges of the window are beige and as the user’s mouse travels up
  and down the edges, orange squares with a red border are drawn up and down the
  center of the window

  <b>Prof WM Harris,</b></a> How

  to draw different shapes mid canvas depending on the mouse position.<br/>

  <b>Functions</b>

  are created for the main canvas set up with the markers on the left and

  right hand sides. One is also created for the location of the mouse

  regarding the canvas and the markers. If the mouse is within the

  outer left hand beige rectangle, then the shape of circle is drawn

  down the center of the canvas. If the mouse is within the outer right

  hand beige rectangle, then the shape of square is drawn down the

  center of the canvas.
