  <b>Prof WM Harris,</b></a> How

  to create Xboxes with one global variable and create conditions with

  boolean variables and boolean expressions by utilizing Boolean

  operators ||, &&, and ! to do boundary checking.<br/>

  <b>Functions</b>

  are created for both the canvas set up as well as the creation of

  the boxes. Background color is dependent on the location of the

  boxes in the canvas space. When mouse button and key are pressed

  simultaneously, the “where” text and box color changes to cyan,

  but if the mouse button is clicked alone then the animation will

  start. When q or Q are pressed the text “Did you type q or Q?”

  will change to blue, else it will be purple. If the mouse is placed

  within the orange box containing the text, “withinRect” then the

  shape will turn pink.
