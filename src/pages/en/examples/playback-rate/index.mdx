title: Playback Rate
arialabel: >-
  Two grey circles on a light grey background that move as the user moves their
  mouse and plays different noises based on their distance from each other
description: >-
  <p>Load a SoundFile and map its playback rate to

  mouseY, volume to mouseX. Playback rate is the speed with

  which the web audio context processings the sound file information.

  Slower rates not only increase the duration of the sound, but also

  decrease the pitch because it is being played back at a slower frequency.</p>
